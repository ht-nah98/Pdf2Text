There are many examples of how ITOCHU has served as an intermediary in establishing joint ventures that contribute to business expansion of the Ting Hsin Intemational Group and penetration to China market by our Japa nese partners. These include beverage production with Asahi BreweriesLtd,conveniencestorebusinesswithFamilyMart, beverage production and sales with Kagome Co., Ltd., and premix flour production and sales with Nippon Flour Mills Co., Ltd. In the area of pharmaceuticals, in March 2011 Liaoning Chengda Co., Ltd., which has a pharmaceutical distribution subsidiary: Alfresa Holdings Corporation; and ITOCHU agreed on establishing comprehensive business ties.

AsanOrganizer ITOCHU utilizes a variety of methods to provide the capabilities and added value necessary in the management strategies of our partners, such as technology and marketing know-how, logistics, and know-how in business administration including intemal control. In addition to providing our own capabilities, we also consider the optimal capital relationship with leading Japanese companies in each area and coordinate the interests between both parties. Thus, as an organizer that brings together various parties, we make full use of our own capabilities and strive to contribute to the success of each project. Our partners in China already have established sales and raw material procurement channels. However, as the living standards and technical needs of consumers are changing rapidly, they would achieve substantial benefits from the assimilation of advanced manufacturing technologies, for differentiation from their competitors. These technologies include the hygiene control and quality control technologies of Japanese companies, which are the best in the world. In the area of food, forinstance, our mass-production bread business is a good example of this process. We are advancing the business through a three-party joint venture scheme that lever- ages the advanced manufacturing technologies and quality con- trol know-how of Shikishima Baking Co., Ltd.
