This is the essence of the \u201cmarket-oriented perspective\u201d approach that we practice, and it does not require any stretch of logic. There is a imit to the added value that upstream resources and materials can generate. Even if a hit product is created, ts ppulartycan beneatympossible to sstan. On the other hand proft margins downstream can become quite significant by identiying customers' needs and adding value accordingy Companies in the raw materials sector may have strengths in advanced technologies, but the com- panies that sel products with added value using those materials are able to eam a much higher level of profit ln Meeting with Berkshire Hathaway Inc.</td><td>many such instances,itis safe to say that proft opportuni- ties are shiting downstream This policyis common among allour businesses, not just the ones that have contact points with consumers. By seizing businessopportunitis in the downstream, we are able to steadily evove ourbusiness model. Take the aforementioned Machinery Company for instance. YANASE & CO., LTD. leveraged its unique sales network, customer base, and the added vae of its after- salcs service,thereby sening as a good example ofa Group company expanding its business results that simuta- neously beneftedupstream manufacturers as well By fgr ing out what it is that consumers want, and with each business strengthening their own brands, we can steadiy create profit generating mechanisms overthe long tem. General trading companies associated with the fomer zaibatsu industrial groups expanded eamings through wide- ranging businesses, mainy n upstream and midstream industrial sectors during the period of postwar recovery and high economic growth. During that time, ITOCHU accumu- lated expertise and steadily buit up its non-resource busi- nesses, especially in the downstream daly consumables realm that is close to consumers. Curenty our competitors are actively working to shit to non-resource businesse. ITOCHU, of course, has an acvantage in this area. The value chain of the ICT& Fnancial Busines Company in particular is one of the main strengths of our businesses, unlike any of the other companis. If the tender offer bid (TOB) for CTC that was recently announced receives the tustoftttaggeraton that this wilbe an investment that contributes to thefrher evolution of ourbusinss going forward. In particular, there is currenty a pressing need to transform business models using digital technologies. Downstream companies are faced with anespecialy strong need to grow theirbusines by analyzing and leveraging data gained from customer contact points to create new added value. To precisely meet diversifying customer needs inlight of these trends. inclding responses to various SDGs related issues, if the TOB is successful, we intend to further accelerate the implementation of strategies in the value chain of the ICT & Financial Business Company and also use this to diferenti- ate ITOCHU from our competitors.
