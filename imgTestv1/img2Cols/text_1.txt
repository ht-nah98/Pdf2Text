DoublingProfitswithSuperA&PStrategy Based on the progress made under A&P-2002, we began implementing SuperA&P-2004,a new two year mid-term plan covering the period from April 1,2003 to March 31,2005. Under the new plan, we willfurther enhance the strategies laid out in the previous A&P plan in order to more fully satisfy our customers, stockholders, employees and society as a whole.We plan to con tinue strengthening our existing designated profit- driving A&P segments (information and multimedia consumer and retail related, natural resource relat- ed, financial services. North America and Asia)
With the newplan,at the same time,we also regard the consumer and retail related sector as a super powerful" segment in which ITOCHU has a strong market presence, and the China business, information and media, solutions, and natural resources as“attractive"businesses to strengthen. Further, as a driving tool for the future, we intend td develop new businesses that are related to innova- tive technologies in fields such as biotechnology and nanotechnology. For the two-year period under the new plan, we intend to increase theratio ofA&Passets to total assets from 50% to 74% including assets in the newly nominated "highly-efficient" seg- mentfromfiscalyear2004,andconsolidated netincomefromA&Psegmentsfrom￥50.7bil- lion to￥88.0billion.Toreach these goals,wewill advance our“selection and concentration”strategy by analyzing the business efficiency of 120busi- ness units and applying one of three strategies: profit doubling,”“2% & 8%”(for semi-core busi- ness units in which we target an ROA of 2% and a risk return index (RRl) of 8%), or “reduction or exit." We intend to both increase profits and strengthen  our financial position by reducing total assets and
dise; and will work to inte- grate all businesses that are closelyrelatedtodailycon- sumer needs. ITOCHU is admittedly one of the largest textile companies in the world. Our food business boasts a top-tier domestic
