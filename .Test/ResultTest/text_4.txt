Risk Management
ITOCHU is exposed to various risks such as market risks, credit
risks and investment risks, due to the nature of its business.
These risks include unpredictable events that may have adverse
effects on its future business and financial performance. ITOCHU
has enhanced its risk management system and risk management
methods to monitor and manage these risks. 
Since the introduction of a “Division Company System” in 1997,
ITOCHU has reinforced the concept of self-management in which
each Division Company manages the risks associated with
individual projects, while the Headquarters has continued to
develop sophisticated risk management methods. ITOCHU has
also established the ALM (Asset Liability Management)
Committee as an advisory body to the HMC (Headquarters
Management Committee), the highest decision-making body in
ITOCHU. The ALM Committee plays a central role in managing
the balance sheets of the whole ITOCHU Group and proposing
improvements, and in analyzing the risk management across
ITOCHU and proposing various risk management methods and
improvements. Specifically, it manages risk exposure for each
individual product and service by setting internal covenants for
major balance sheet items and segmenting products and
services in detail to set exposure limits, criteria to undertake, and
standards for return.
Furthermore, ITOCHU has introduced RCM (Risk Capital
Management), a risk management method based on RAROC
(Risk-adjusted Return on Capital) to thoroughly manage its
business portfolio through the utilization of two management
benchmark: Risk Assets and Risk Return Index.  
Market Risks
ITOCHU is exposed to market risks such as foreign exchange
rate risk, interest rate risk, commodity price risk and stock price
risk. ITOCHU aims to minimize risks relating to market
fluctuations such as changes in foreign exchange rates and
interest rates by establishing a risk management system using
balance limit and other such measures and by utilizing a variety of
derivative instruments for hedging purposes. Please refer to
ITOCHU’s accounting policy for derivative instruments in notes to
consolidated financial statements “2. Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies” and “19. Financial Instruments.” 
Foreign Exchange Rate Risk
ITOCHU is exposed to foreign exchange rate risk regarding
transactions denominated in foreign currencies due to its
significant involvement in import/export trading. ITOCHU uses
forward exchange contracts and currency swap contracts to
minimize risks for these transactions. Also, to manage foreign
currency balance, ITOCHU sets limits on foreign exchange rate
risks (limit of balance and that of loss), whereby it manages its
balance of foreign currency by contract amount, the amount of
its own/others’ risk, and short-term/long-term. Since ITOCHU
engages in businesses involving foreign currencies with a
number of overseas trading subsidiaries and other overseas
group subsidiaries, the figures denominated in Japanese yen on
its consolidated balance sheet are also exposed to so-called
foreign currency translation risk. ITOCHU does not hedge the
translation risk, which does not have an impact on its financial
and business performance denominated in foreign currencies.

Interest Rate Risk
ITOCHU is exposed to interest rate risk in fund raising or using
by its lending, investing, and operating activities. Interest rate
risk refers to the risk of income fluctuation caused by changes
to interest rates, when mismatches in interest rates and
durations occur. Interest rate risk is, on the whole, expressed
by the equation of “balance x magnitude of interest rate change
x duration.” 
To control interest rate risk in a concrete and objective
manner, ITOCHU has grappled with quantification of interest
rate risk by measuring interest rate risk with a new
methodology, “Earning at Risk (EaR).” Based on the results of
EaR, ITOCHU sets a certain limit (Loss Cut Limit) as the highest
acceptable interest payment, and executes hedging
transactions to maintain the loss cut limit. ITOCHU mainly
utilizes interest rate swaps to minimize interest rate risk. EaR is
monitored every month and a review of the loss cut limit
situation is carried out regularly.
Commodity Price Risk
ITOCHU is exposed to commodity price risk on commodity
products that it trades such as crude oil and grain. In ITOCHU,
each Division Company sets its own risk management policy
and manages purchase contracts, inventories and sales
contracts including off-balance sheet items. In addition,
particularly for products that have high price volatilities and may
have a large impact on ITOCHU’s management, ITOCHU
designates them as “specified important products” and each
Division Company sets and manages a balance limit and loss
cut limit for each individual product. The loss cut limits for
products with a large amount of trading are examined by the
ALM Committee and approved by the HMC. The trading
volumes of specified important products are regularly reviewed
and reported to the ALM Committee along with their product
management standards and methods. ITOCHU is reducing
commodity price risk by minimizing the balance of products
and by utilizing futures or forward contracts. For price
fluctuation risk of ship charter fares regarding shipping balance
ITOCHU owns for its own use, like specified important
products, it sets and manages balance limit and loss cut limit.
Stock Price Risk
ITOCHU holds available-for-sale marketable securities which
are vulnerable to price fluctuation. As for stock price risk,
ITOCHU aims to optimize the amount of investments by
applying exit rules for inefficient and less meaningful
investments, because hedging by derivative instruments is not
effective for available-for-sale marketable securities held for
long-term. Fair value of the available-for-sale marketable
securities held by ITOCHU was ¥167.4 billion as of March 31,
2003 and ¥256.1 billion as of March 31, 2002. In cases where
the aggregate prices of these investments had fluctuated by
10%, fair value would also have fluctuated by ¥16.7 billion as of
March 31, 2003 and by ¥25.6 billion as of March 31, 2002.
