SPECIAL 
FEATURE 2
To Lead A New Era
Pursuing Risk Management and 
Asset Efficiency
Asset Replacement and Cash Flow Management in the “New Era for the Sogo Shosha”
In FYE 2016, ITOCHU moved quickly to replace low efficient assets and further strengthened its cash flow management. 
In addition, we conducted detailed analyses in both the non-resource and resource sectors and took a thorough 
approach to recording losses in order to reduce future risks. The purpose of those initiatives was to build a more solid 
foundation that will be able to withstand changes in the economic environment in order to lead in the “New Era for the  
Sogo Shosha.”
Increasing Asset Quality 
through the Strengthening of 
Our Financial Position
ITOCHU has continually taken steps 
from an early stage to address future 
potential risks. In FYE 2016, we deter-
mined uncertainty in the economic 
 environment was increasing, and we 
decided to record approximately ¥90.0 
billion in losses.
In the resources sector, we rigor-
ously selected businesses, and we 
decided to sell certain coal interests in 
Australia. In addition, we conservatively 
revised our outlook for commodity 
prices over the long term, and recorded 
impairment losses at IMEA and a North 
Sea crude oil project.
In addition to the resource sector, 
we also conducted detailed analyses of 
asset values in the non-resource sector, 
where we have a competitive edge, and 
worked to clear away concerns about 
the future. For example, at LeSportsac, 
which earns nearly 15% of the trade-
mark rights value in the textile business, 
we recognized impairment losses when 
we implemented replacement to intro-
duce products with higher added value. 
In addition, we decided to withdraw 
from Bramhope, a major UK-based 
manufacturer and wholesaler of 
apparel. Moreover, for Dole, where 
impairment losses were anticipated due 
to insufficient harvests, we conserva-
tively reevaluated the uncertainty of 
agricultural products and recognized 
additional impairment for the entire 
amount of goodwill and a portion of 
intangible assets. For ETEL, a tire 
wholesaler and retailer in Europe, we 
conservatively took into consideration 
the forecast for tire demand over the 
medium to long term and recorded 
impairment losses of ¥31.0 billion on 
goodwill. The various types of impair-
ment loss processing that we imple-
mented in FYE 2016 were one facet of 
our efforts to “strengthen our financial 
position,” a basic policy of the medium-
term management plan.
  The next section introduces exam-
ples of asset replacement that were 
implemented from the viewpoint of 
 corporate value that is suitable for the 
“New Era for the Sogo Shosha.”
