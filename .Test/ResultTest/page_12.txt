Accumulation of Non-Financial Capital
■ Sustainable Value Creation through Strengthening of Trust and Creditworthiness
ITOCHU conducts its business through both trade and business investment. In the course of our history over 160 years, 
we have steadily accumulated internal capital through our business, such as human and organizational capital and 
 business know-how.
  We believe that trust and creditworthiness are extremely important for the symbiosis of internal and external capital, 
which mutually influence each other. By always remaining conscious of trust and creditworthiness in our management 
practices, we aim to continuously enhance corporate value through realizing growth in both economic value and 
 environmental / social value.
