Plan
For fiscal 2005, the net income from subsidiaries and equity-
method associated companies (the aggregate profits/losses of
subsidiaries and equity-method associated companies exclud-
ing overseas trading subsidiaries, the same definition applies
below) amounted to a gain of ¥47.9 billion, a significant rise
compared to a loss of ¥28.5 billion in the previous fiscal year.
Similarly, the share of Group companies reporting profits (the
ratio of companies reporting profits to total Group companies)
also improved from 77.8% to 83.1%. Excluding the impairment
loss on investment in FamilyMart recognized in fiscal 2005 and
the impairment losses on long-lived assets recognized in fiscal
2004, Group companies recorded a profit of ¥74.5 billion, with
83.2% of the companies recording a profit. This marked an
improvement of ¥24.7 billion and 0.4 percentage points,
respectively. Profits from ITOCHU’s overseas trading sub-
sidiaries reached ¥13.2 billion, an increase of ¥8.1 billion from
the previous fiscal year. As can be seen from the improvement
in both profits and losses for the combined total of Group com-
panies and overseas trading subsidiaries, the profitability of
consolidated companies has shown strong improvement.
