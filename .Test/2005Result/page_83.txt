Financial Position
Total assets as of the end of the fiscal year decreased by
¥14.9 billion from fiscal 2004 to ¥4,472.3 billion ($41,646 mil-
lion) due to improved collections of trade receivables, reduc-
tions resulted form the write down of impaired goodwill
involving FamilyMart, a decrease in cash and cash equiva-
lents applied to the repayments of interest-bearing debts,
which were partially offset by increases in trade receivables
and inventory due to rising prices of marketable commodities
represented by crude oil prices and new or additional invest-
ments in Orico and Isuzu. Stockholder’s equity increased
¥87.5 billion (20.7%) from fiscal 2004 to ¥510.4 billion
($4,753 million). This was due to improvements in unrealized
holdings gains (losses) on securities and foreign currency
translation adjustments, in addition to an accumulation of
retained earnings through solid business performance. As a
result, the equity ratio showed a 2.0 percentage point
improvement from fiscal 2004 to 11.4%.
Net interest-bearing debts less cash and cash equivalents
and time deposits decreased by ¥86.0 billion (4.3%) to
¥1,891.1 billion ($17,610 million) from fiscal 2004. As a result,
and also partly because of the increase in shareholder’s
equity, net DER (debt-to-equity ratio) improved by 1.0 from
fiscal 2004 to 3.7 times.

The main increases or decreases from the end of fiscal
Other investments increased by ¥55.3 billion to ¥441.8 bil-
2004 in the items on the balance sheet are as follows:
Cash and cash equivalents decreased by ¥126.6 billion to
¥452.9 billion ($4,218 million) from fiscal 2004. This was due
to repayment of interest-bearing debts to improve the
Company’s financial position after securing sufficient liquidity
reserves. 
Trade receivables (less allowance for doubtful receiv-
ables) increased ¥28.4 billion to ¥1,085.9 billion ($10,111 mil-
lion) from fiscal 2004. This was due primarily to increases in
Chemicals, Forest products & General Merchandise and
Energy, Metals & Minerals, in accordance with increased net
sales caused by rising prices and volumes of marketable
commodities.
Inventories increased ¥45.9 billion from fiscal 2004 to
¥420.1 billion ($3,912 million) as a result of increases in
Machinery, Aerospace, Electronics & Multimedia, Energy,
Metals & Minerals, Chemicals, Forest products & General
Merchandise, which occurred due to rising prices of mar-
ketable commodities and sales volume expansion.
Additionally, there was an increase in advances to suppli-
ers (a ¥39.7 billion increase from fiscal 2004  to ¥86.5 billion
($805 million), due mainly to growth in the Machinery,
Aerospace, Electronics & Multimedia) and a decrease in other
current assets, (a ¥25.4 billion decrease from fiscal 2004 to
¥191.6 billion ($1,784 million), due to reductions mainly in
income receivable).  
As a result, current assets for the fiscal year were ¥2,441.9
billion ($22,739 million), down ¥21.3 billion from fiscal 2004.
Investments in and advances to associated companies
increased due to the incorporation of equity-method associ-
ated companies in Energy, Metals & Minerals, and Food.
However, there was a decrease of ¥9.0 billion to ¥472.5 bil-
lion ($4,400 million) from fiscal 2004 due to the decrease
(¥45.1 billion) resulting from the write down of impaired good-
will involving FamilyMart.
lion ($4,114 million) from fiscal 2004, due primarily to new
investments in the preferred stocks of Orico and additional
investments in Isuzu.
Other non-current receivables (less allowance for doubt-
ful receivables) experienced a decrease, due mainly to the
collection of machinery-related non-current receivables, drop-
ping ¥21.9 billion from fiscal 2004 to ¥186.4 billion ($1,735
million). 
As a result, total investments and non-current receivables
were up ¥24.4 billion from fiscal 2004 to ¥1,100.6 billion
($10,249 million).
At the end of fiscal 2005, EITF 04-2,"Whether Mineral
Rights are Tangible or Intangible Assets." has been applied to
property and equipment, at cost (less accumulated depre-
ciation) and mineral rights. Although conventionally included
in Other Assets, such rights are now included in property and
equipment. After reclassifying fiscal 2004’s figure in the same
way, the value is down ¥9.7 billion from fiscal 2004 at ¥497.4
billion ($4,631 million).
Deferred tax assets, non-current increased due to the
recognition of the impairment of the equity method invest-
ment in FamilyMart, however the final result was a ¥20.0 bil-
lion decrease from fiscal 2004 to ¥109.1 billion ($1,016
million). The decrease was a result of tax basis losses through
dispositions of loans, corporate stocks, and real estate. Such
losses had already been recognized for financial statement
purposes. The net value of short-term and long-term deferred
tax assets and liabilities also dropped by ¥15.2 billion from
fiscal 2004 to ¥136.7 billion ($1,274 million), due to losses of
taxation.
Goodwill and other intangible assets, less accumulated
amortization increased ¥7.9billion from fiscal 2004 to ¥94.7
billion ($882 million) due mainly to additional purchases of
consolidated subsidiary company stock. 
Short-term debt was down ¥128.1 billion from fiscal 2004
