Business Results for Fiscal 2005 - A Comparison between Fiscal 2005 and Fiscal 2004
Revenue (the total of “Sales revenue” and “Trading margins
and commissions on trading transactions”) increased by 14.5%
or ¥252.5 billion from the previous fiscal year to ¥1,991.2 billion
($18,542 million) principally from an increase in natural
resource-related transactions amid a spike in commodity mar-
ket prices in Energy, Metals and Minerals segment and from
strong demand in the construction machinery and general mer-
chandise field in North America.
Gross trading profit increased by 13.5% or ¥74.9 billion
from the previous fiscal year to ¥630.8 billion ($5,874 million).
Profits increased in Textile segment due largely to higher
transaction volumes tied to newly acquired business transac-
tions; in Machinery segment as a result of an increase in ship
related business, higher sales of automobiles in Europe, and
solid performance in the construction machinery business in
North America; in Energy, Metals and Minerals segment due
mainly to rising market prices of coal, iron ore as well as higher
crude oil prices and transaction volume; in Chemicals, Forest
Products and General Merchandise segment on the back of
high market prices for chemical products, and solid growth in
building material transactions in North America; and in
Finance, Realty, Insurance and Logistics Services segment
due primarily to an increase in residential unit sales. In addition
no significant impairment losses on long-lived assets and
write-downs of real estate inventories were recorded in this
fiscal year compared to the previous fiscal year.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by
0.9% or ¥3.9 billion from the previous fiscal year to ¥466.8 bil-
lion ($4,347 million) with the expansion in business and
despite a decrease in pension plan reserves. In Fiscal 2004,
following the transfer of the substitutional portion of
Employee’s Pension Fund to the government in Japan,
Settlement loss from the transfer of the substitutional por-
tion of the Employee’s Pension Fund of ¥22.8 billion and
Subsidy from government on the transfer of the substitu-
tional portion of the Employees’ Pension Fund of ¥19.6 mil-
lion were recognized respectively.
Provisions for doubtful receivables improved by 41.8% or
¥4.4 billion from the previous fiscal year to ¥6.2 billion ($58
million) due principally to a decrease in bad debt.
The net financial expenses, the net of interest income,
interest expense and dividends received, improved by 51.6%
or ¥7.3 billion from the previous fiscal year to expense of ¥6.9
billion ($65 million). This resulted principally from an increase in
dividends from LNG-related investments and a decrease in
interest expenses by 15.0% or ¥3.7 billion caused by a reduc-
tion of interest-bearing debts.
Loss on disposal of investments and marketable securi-
ties, including write-down deteriorated by ¥11.8 billion from
the previous fiscal year to ¥25.4 billion ($236 million) due pri-
marily to an impairment loss of ¥45.1 billion relating to the
investment in FamilyMart despite of IPO gains of subsidiaries
and associated companies.
Losses on property and equipment-net improved by
¥123.5 billion from the previous fiscal year to ¥6.0 billion ($55
million), mainly reflecting the absence of large impairment
losses on long-lived assets recorded in the previous year.
Other-net improved by ¥14.4 billion from the previous fiscal
year to a gain of ¥0.4 billion ($4 million) due principally to
improved foreign exchange results. 
As a result, income (loss) before income taxes, minority
interests, equity in earnings of associated companies and
extraordinary items improved by ¥212.0 billion from the previ-
ous fiscal year to ¥120.0 billion ($1,117 million). 
Income taxes increased by ¥108.0 billion from the previous
fiscal year to ¥62.5 billion ($582 million), Minority interests
increased by 13.4% or ¥1.3 billion from the previous fiscal
year to ¥11.4 billion ($107 million). Additionally, Equity in earn-
ings of associated companies improved by 39.0% or ¥8.9 bil-
lion to ¥31.8 billion ($296 million) due principally to strong
operating performance of a steel business associated com-
pany. Net income before extraordinary items improved by
¥111.6 billion from the previous fiscal year to ¥77.8 billion
($724 million).
Extraordinary items - gain on negative goodwill totaling
¥1.8 billion (less applicable income taxes of ¥1.3 billion) was
recognized in 2004 due to newly acquired associated compa-
nies. As a result, Net income (loss) improved by ¥109.7 billion
to ¥77.8 billion.
Total trading transactions, represent transaction volume
and are parenthetically disclosed in the statement of opera-
tions, increased due principally to a large increase in Energy,
Metals, and Minerals segment resulting from rising market
prices for coal, iron ore, and crude oil, and also due to a large
increase in Chemicals, Forest Products & General
Merchandise segment caused by favorable market prices in
chemical products as well as higher building material transac-
tions in North American market. Although the termination of
low-efficiency transactions and the impact of the stronger yen
in this fiscal year over the transactions provided negative
effects, total trading transactions increased by 0.6% or ¥59.1
billion from the previous fiscal year to ¥9,576.0 billion ($89,171
million), marking the first annual increase in trading transac-
tions since the year ended March 31, 1999 (“Fiscal 1999”).
