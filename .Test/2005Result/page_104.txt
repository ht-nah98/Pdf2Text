At March 31, 2005 the Company and its subsidiaries held the
securities of approximately 40 issuers with an unrealized hold-
ing loss in its available-for-sale portfolio. The severity of
decline in fair value below cost was 1% to 25% and the dura-
tion of the impairment was less than 9 months. As a result of
evaluation of individual severity and duration of these securi-
ties and the prospects of the issuer, the Company and its
subsidiaries concluded the fair values of these securities
would recover in the near-term. Based on that evaluation and
the Company and its subsidiaries’ intent and ability to hold
these investments for a reasonable period of time sufficient for
a forecasted recovery of fair value, the Company and its sub-
sidiaries did not consider these investments to be other-than-
temporarily impaired at March 31, 2005.
The contractual maturities of debt securities classified as available-for-sale and held-to-maturity as of March 31, 2005 were as follows:
