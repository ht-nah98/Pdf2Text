to ¥421.7 billion ($3,927 million), and current maturities of
long-term debt were down ¥80.3 billion from fiscal 2004 to
¥255.2 billion ($2,376 million). This was due to repayments of
interest-bearing debts, efforts for long-term funding and the
classification of ¥210.0 billion ($1,955 million) of the current
maturities of long-term debt. The Company has entered into
commitment line agreements which are intended to be used
solely in support of refinancing the current maturities of long-
term debt. (Note: Refer to Note 9 “Short-term and long-term
debt” to the consolidated financial statements)
Trade payables increased by ¥57.9 billion to ¥966.9 billion
($9,004 million) from fiscal 2004. This was due primarily to
increases in Energy, Metals & Minerals, Chemicals, Forest
products & General and Food, in accordance with improved
business due to rising prices of marketable commodities.
In addition, there was an increase in advances from cus-
tomers (a ¥36.7 billion increase from fiscal 2004 to ¥90.2 bil-
lion ($839 million), due mainly to increases in Machinery,
Aerospace, Electronics & Multimedia). There were also
increases in other current liabilities, (a ¥17.4 billion increase
from fiscal 2004 ¥161.1 billion ($1,501 million), mainly due to
increases in Aerospace, Electronics & Multimedia).
As a result, current liabilities were ¥2,060.1 billion ($19,184
million), down ¥85.0 billion from fiscal 2004.
Reserves for Liquidity 
The basic policy of the Company is to maintain and secure
and adequate amount for short-term interest-bearing debts
and contingent liabilities due within three months from a cer-
tain point of time for the necessary amount of reserves
required for liquidity. This policy is based on the scenario
whereby new funding may be unavailable for about three
months because of market turmoil. In such a case, the
Company must maintain adequate reserves to repay liabilities
during such a period in order to cope with unpredictable
events. 
The Company has a long-term commitment line with finan-
cial institutions totaling ¥210.0 billion ($1,955 million) with a
May 18, 2007 maturity. Against the background of this long-
term commitment line, the Company has the intention and the
ability for a long-term rollover of current maturities of long-term
debt from financial institutions. It thus classified ¥210.0 billion
($1,955 million) of current maturities of long-term debt to non-
current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. This was
part of ¥465.2 billion ($4,331 million) in non-current liabilities
with a deadline of one year or less based on loan contracts at
the end of fiscal 2005. 
However, in the table that follows, classification as shown
below is in accordance with loan contract repayments.
Primary liquidity resources for this fiscal year, the summa-
tion of cash, cash equivalents, time deposits (¥455.6 billion),
commitment line agreements (short-term ¥300.0 billion and
long-term 210.0 billion) and commitment long-term loan
agreement (¥17.0 billion) were ¥982.6 billion, a reduction of
¥62.3 billion from the previous fiscal year.
The total amount of liquidity reserves, or primary liquidity
reserves and secondary liquidity reserves (other assets that
can be changed into cash in a short period of time) stood at
¥1,440.1 billion. The Company believes that this amount con-
stitutes adequate reserves of liquidity, since it is more than
three times the necessary liquidity amount (short-term inter-
est-bearing debts and contingent liabilities due within three
months), which amounted to ¥361.5 billion as of March
31,2005.
