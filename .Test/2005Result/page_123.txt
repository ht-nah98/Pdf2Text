going basis, as to whether the derivatives used in hedging
activities are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values
or cash flows of hedged items.
Fair Value Hedge
Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated
and qualified as fair value hedges of recognized assets and lia-
bilities or unrecognized firm commitments are recognized in
earnings together with changes in the fair value of the corre-
sponding hedged items.
The amount of the hedge ineffectiveness and net gain or
loss excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness
was not material for the years ended March 31, 2005, 2004
and 2003.
The amount of net gain or loss recognized in earnings when
the hedged firm commitment no longer qualified as a fair value
hedge was not material for the years ended March 31, 2005,
2004 and 2003.
Cash Flow Hedge
Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated
and qualified as cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions
and recognized assets and liabilities are reported in accumu-
lated other comprehensive income (loss) (referred to as AOCI).
These amounts are reclassified into earnings in the same
period as the hedged items affect earnings.
Changes in the fair value of interest rate swap designated
as hedging instruments are initially recorded in AOCI and
reclassified into earnings as interest expense when the
hedged items affect earnings.
The amount of the hedge ineffectiveness and net gain or loss
Net losses of ¥2,464 million ($23 million), ¥3,380 million and
¥2,806 million were reclassified from AOCI into earnings dur-
ing the years ended March 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respec-
tively, when the hedged items affected earnings. 
Net losses of ¥1,941 million ($18 million) in AOCI at March
31, 2005 are expected to be reclassified to earnings within the
next 12 months.
As of March 31, 2005, the maximum length of time over
which the Company and its subsidiaries are hedging their
exposure to variability in future cash flows for forecasted
transactions excluding those forecasted transactions related
to the payment of variable interest on existing financial instru-
ments is approximately 62 months.
The amount of net gain or loss reclassified into earnings
because it was probable that forecasted transactions would
not occur was immaterial for the years ended March 31, 2005,
2004 and 2003.
Derivative instruments held or issued for trading purposes
were insignificant.
(2) Fair Values of Financial Instruments
The Company and its subsidiaries have various financial
instruments, which are exposed to credit losses in the event of
non-performance by counterparties.
The Company and its subsidiaries are engaged in transac-
tions with numerous counterparties to ensure that there are no
significant concentrations of credit risk with any individual
counterparty or groups of counterparties.
excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness is not
material for the years ended March 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003.
