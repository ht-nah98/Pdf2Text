2. Boosting Our Ratio of Profitable Companies and
Expanding the Profit Contribution from Group
Companies
In order to expand the profit from group companies, which
are a key constituent of ITOCHU’s consolidated net
income, we developed and strengthened our core compa-
nies, whose profit contributions total more than ¥1.0 bil-
lion, and semi-core companies, who make a ¥0.3 billion to
¥1.0 billion profit contribution. For companies could not
reach such benchmarks as absolute profit levels, ROA,
and RRI indexes, reduction or exit measures were taken. 
As a result, a less-than-gratifying ¥47.4 billion profit from
group companies in the fiscal year ended March 2003
rose by approximately 1.6 times to ¥74.5 billion (excluding
goodwill impairment relating to shares of FamilyMart).
These gains led to an increase in the ratio of profitable
companies from 80.2% to 83.1%. 
3. Further Improving Our Financial Position
Net interest-bearing debts were reduced from ¥2,025.0 bil-
lion in the fiscal year ended March 2003 to ¥1,891.1 billion
in the fiscal year ended March 2005, exceeding the target
under the plan. Meanwhile, stockholders’ equity was affect-
ed by impairment losses for fixed assets in the previous
term and for goodwill on FamilyMart shares in the term
under review. Consequently, we did not reach the target of
¥540 billion initially specified in the plan. We did, however,
achieve a rise in stockholders’ equity from ¥426.2 billion to
¥510.4 billion during the two-year period of the plan, result-
ing in a reduction of net DER from 4.8 times to 3.7 times,
approaching the target of 3.6 times. In addition, with the
increase in stockholders’ equity being under the planned
target, equity ratio just missed the target level. Nevertheless,
it still reached 11.4%, an improvement of 1.9 percentage
points compared to the fiscal year ended March 2003.
