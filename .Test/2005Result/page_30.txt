Business Performance and Priority Policies in Fiscal
Year 2005
The overall business environment for fiscal year 2005 was
favorable. Despite slow growth in new mobile phone sub-
scribers  due  to  a  maturation  of  the  market  and  falling
prices of IT products and services, a recovery in IT invest-
ment  was  accompanied  by  improving  corporate  profits
and  strong  Internet  advertising  market  growth  was
observed.
Amidst  these  trends,  we  focused  on  establishing  new
businesses that will make up the Division Company’s core
businesses in the future. As such, we launched our VOD
(Video  on  Demand)  business  and  established  JAPAN
AEROSPACE CORPORATION, which took over the aero-
space  business  of  the  former  KAWASHO  CORPORA-
TION.  We  also  focused  on  developing  group  companies
targeted for future stock listings.
