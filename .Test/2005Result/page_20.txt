Special Feature 2: Business Development in ITOCHU’s Key Areas of Competence
Further Advancing ITOCHU’s
Growth Model through Its Consumer-
Related Business
At ITOCHU, the consumer-related field is our key area of expansion. One of our most important growth
models involves making use of our comprehensive vertical strengths. This means diverse shifts in con-
sumer needs are correctly grasped downstream, products that meet those needs are manufactured effi-
ciently and at a low cost upstream, and these products are supplied in a timely fashion through our
midstream operations.  
In addition to using our comprehensive vertical strengths, we are also pursuing a new growth model
that is based on comprehensive lateral strengths. This approach goes beyond our traditional vertical
framework of sectionalized Division Companies to provide products and services that satisfy con-
sumers under a comprehensive cross-company system.
Our third growth model is designed to develop these two models together on a global scale to expand
the business foundation itself. 
ITOCHU strives to combine these three business models to establish an advanced growth model that
is unique to our Company. Further explanation is given below, using our food business as an example.
1. Developing Comprehensive Vertical
Strengths Centered on Our
FamilyMart Business
In the food segment, we have established
a  consistent  product  development
process  as  a  general  trading  company,
which  is  carried  through  our  down-
stream,  midstream,  and  upstream  opera-
tions  as  well  as  a  nationwide  system  of
procurement and supply having conven-
ience  store  FamilyMart  at  the  forefront
of  the  retail  area.  We  maximize  our
Group’s  comprehensive  strengths  by
establishing such value chains in cooper-
ation with FamilyMart and by enhancing
their individual functions. 
One  specific  example  of  a  successful
model is the development of FamilyMart’s
growing  product  category  of  fast  foods
and  original  snack  brand.  Together  with
FamilyMart, we quickly grasp consumer
needs to develop ideas for new products.
At  the  same  time,  we  use  the  procure-
ment  capabilities  of  our  Group  to  pro-
pose the most suitable raw materials and
packaging.  Developing  products  and
procuring  raw  materials  in  cooperation
with  ITOCHU’s  worldwide  network  of
suppliers has allowed us to supply com-
petitive  products  at  a  fast  pace.  In  this
