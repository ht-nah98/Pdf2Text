The analysis by operating segment is based on the division
company system which the Company adopted for measuring
management performance. The total trading transactions
shown in the following analysis represent those recorded in a
division company and exclude transfers between operating
segments.
Textile:
Trading transactions increased by 1.5% or ¥12.1 billion year-
over-year to ¥829.1 billion ($7,720 million) led by growth from
the acquisition of new trade rights in brand-related fields as
well as new transactions. Gross trading profit increased by
12.5% or ¥12.5 billion year-over-year to ¥112.8 billion ($1,051
million) due principally to contributions from new subsidiaries in
brand-related fields in addition to existing businesses. Along
with the rise in gross trading profits, net income surged by
26.8% or ¥3.1 billion year-over-year to ¥14.8 billion ($138 mil-
lion). Reflecting the collection of operating receivables, identifi-
able assets in this segment decreased by 1.4% or ¥5.5 billion
to ¥377.2 billion ($3,513 million). 
Machinery:
Trading transactions decreased by 17.1% or ¥240.3 billion to
¥1,166.7 billion ($10,864 million) as a result of the termination of
low profit transactions as well as the effect of large plant pro-
jects experienced in the previous fiscal year which did not recur
in the current year. Gross trading profits increased by 13.4% or
¥6.9 billion to ¥58.0 billion ($540 million) due mainly to strength
in transactions of ships and automobile sales in Europe and
North America as well as positive trends in North American con-
struction machinery operations. With the improvement in gross
trading profits, a large decrease in impairment losses in long-
lived assets, and an increase in equity in earnings of associated
companies, net income jumped by 171.9% or ¥6.6 billion to
¥10.5 billion ($97 million). Identifiable assets in this segment
increased by 4.1% or ¥17.9 billion to ¥451.4 billion ($4,204 mil-
lion) due principally to an additional investment in Isuzu and an
increase in automobiles and ships transactions although a
decrease in operating receivables resulted from collections.
Aerospace, Electronics & Multimedia:
Trading transactions decreased by 0.5% or ¥3.1 billion to
¥630.9 billion ($5,875 million). Trading transaction increases
from mobile phone-related operations and an acquisition in
the aerospace field were offset by the termination of lower
profit transactions and decreases in domestic communica-
tions-related operations. Despite the drop in domestic com-
munications-related transactions, gross trading profit
increased by 2.8% or ¥2.9 billion to ¥108.4 billion ($1,010 mil-
lion) due mainly to the impact from the aerospace-related
acquisition and positive trends in mobile phone-related opera-
tions. Net income soared by 457.7% or ¥11.8 billion to ¥14.4
billion ($134 million) on the back of the improvement in gross
trading profits as well as IPO gains of subsidiaries and a
decrease in losses from business liquidations. Boosted by the
impact of the acquisition in the aerospace sector, identifiable
assets in this segment increased by 5.4% or ¥25.1 billion to
¥489.4 billion ($4,557 million).
