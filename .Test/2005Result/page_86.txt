Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations
ITOCHU issues various guarantees for indebtedness including
bank loans to subsidiaries, equity-method associated compa-
nies and customers. Because the guaranteed borrowings of
subsidiaries are included in the Company’s consolidated
financial statements, off-balance sheet guarantees are solely
the total guarantees to equity-method associated companies
and customers. The breakdown of guarantees as of March
31, 2004 and 2003 is as follows:

The maximum potential amount of future payments of the
Company under the guarantee contracts is presented above.
The amount of substantial risk represents the total amount of
the substantial risk taken, based on the actual amount of liabil-
ity incurred by the guaranteed parties as of the end of the
respective term within the pre-determined guaranteed limit
established under the guarantee contracts. The amounts that
can be recovered from third parties under the back-to-back
guarantees submitted by them to the Company or subsidiaries
concerned have been excluded in determining the amount of
substantial risk. The disclosures related to guarantees are
shown in Note 22 “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities” to
the consolidated financial statements.
The disclosures related to variable interest entities defined
under the provisions of Financial Accounting Standard Board
Interpretation No. 46 “Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities” are shown in Note 21 “Variable Interest Entities” to
the consolidated financial statements.
