In addition, acceptances payable were secured by trust
receipts on merchandise and the proceeds from the sale
thereof. Because of the large volume of import transactions,
the amount of such assets pledged is not determinable.
Both short-term and long-term loans are generally made
pursuant to agreements which customarily provide that, upon
the request of the lender, collateral or guarantors (or additional
collateral or guarantors) will be furnished with respect to the
loans under certain circumstances, and that the lender may
treat any collateral, whether furnished for specific loans or oth-
erwise, as collateral for present and future indebtedness to
such lender. Several of the bank loan agreements also provide
that the lending bank has the right to offset deposited cash
with it against any debt (including debt arising out of contin-
gent obligations) to the bank that has become due at stated
maturity or earlier.
