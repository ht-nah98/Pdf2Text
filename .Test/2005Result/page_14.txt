ITOCHU’S GROWTH STRATEGY
Review of Super A&P-2004
(from April 2003 to March 2005)
Since the fiscal year ended March 2004, ITOCHU
has implemented its two-year mid-term manage-
ment plan, Super A&P-2004, which represents the
final phase of the A&P strategy launched in the fis-
cal year ended March 2002. 
The A&P strategy defines A&P segments as fields
and regions attractive to customers and in which
ITOCHU is powerful. It then sets the framework for
accelerating the reallocation of assets to these
highly-efficient segments, thereby boosting asset
efficiency and increasing earnings.  
Our numerical targets for the fiscal year ended
March 2005, as set at the start of the mid-term man-
agement plan, were affected by early application in
the fiscal year ended March 2004 of impairment
accounting for fixed assets under Japan GAAP.
Although we fell somewhat short of the plan’s initial
target of ¥540 billon in stockholders’ equity, we
essentially reached our main targets for net income,
ROA, ROE, and net DER. We also achieved most of
our various policy and qualitative targets, and deter-
mined that we could achieve fully satisfactory
results concerning the reform of our profit structure
and an improvement in our financial position, which
are the overall objectives of the A&P strategy. 
1. Enhancing Our Profitability through an Optimized
Asset Portfolio
Highly-efficient business units including the A&P seg-
ments, namely those with at least 2% of ROA and at least
8% of RRI*, were targeted for earnings expansion through
strategic investment. Meanwhile, less-efficient business
units that failed to satisfy these requirements were subject
to drastic downsizing and withdrawal measures. 
As a result, we succeeded in building a high profit
structure by increasing the proportion of total assets
accounted for by A&P and other highly-efficient segments
from 50% at the end of the fiscal year ended March 2003
to 78% at the end of the fiscal year under review.  
ITOCHU set the scope of strategic investment to a total
of ¥100 billion over the two-year period and invested par-
ticularly in the Consumer and Retail Related segment and
in Asia, especially China. These investments include a
coal development project in Australia (approximately ¥22
billion), Orient Corporation (approximately ¥22 billion**),
Isuzu Motors Ltd. (approximately ¥19 billion), Prima Meat
Packers, Ltd. (approximately ¥6 billion), and a joint ven-
ture with Asahi Breweries, Ltd. in the soft drink business
in China (approximately ¥3 billion). 
* RRI (Risk Return Index) = Net income/Risk assets
Risk assets = Maximum potential loss from possession of assets
= ∑ (Asset book value x Risk weight for each asset)
** The total amount of investment up to the present in Orient
Corporation, including investments in the fiscal year ending March
2006, is approximately ¥70 billion.
