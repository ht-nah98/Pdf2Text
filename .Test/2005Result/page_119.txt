The Company issued 158,000,000 shares of common stock

The Code permits Japanese companies to repurchase trea-
sury stock upon the approval of the Board of Directors, as far
as it is permitted under the Articles of Incorporation, subject to
limitations imposed by the Code. The Code also permits
Japanese companies to dispose of their own shares by resolu-
tion of the Board of Directors, unless otherwise specified in the
Code, or if the Articles of Incorporation do not require a resolu-
tion of the shareholders at the shareholders’ meeting.
Reference is made to note 23, “Subsequent events”, for the
amendment of the Articles of Incorporation at the ordinary gen-
eral meeting of shareholders at June 29, 2005.
16. Capital Surplus and Retained Earnings
The Code provides that at least 10% of the total amount of
cash dividends and other cash appropriations of retained earn-
ings applicable to each fiscal period shall be appropriated to a
legal reserve until an aggregated amount of capital surplus and

financial statements to conform with U.S. GAAP, but not
recorded in the books of account, have no effect on the deter-
mination of retained earnings available for dividends under the
Code. The amount available for dividends under the Code was
¥28,800 million ($268 million) as of March 31, 2005.

Company, the shareholders approved a proposal to eliminate

($1,022 million) from the Company’s books of account by a
transfer from capital surplus as permitted by the Code.
Because the Company’s accumulated deficit in the U.S.
GAAP consolidated financial statements on that date was not
significantly different from the Company’s books of account,
the Company reflected the deficit reclassification entry on its
books of account when preparing the consolidated financial
statements in reliance on private company practices in the
United States of America. The balance of the consolidated
retained earnings as of March 31, 2005 would have been
¥78,401 million ($730 million) including a legal reserve of
¥3,927 million ($37 million) had the Company not eliminated
