Energy, Metals & Minerals:
Trading transactions increased by 15.6% or ¥333.3 billion to
¥2,471.5 billion ($23,014 million) as a result of higher prices for
coal and iron ore and increases in transaction volumes. Price
increases for crude oil and petroleum products coupled with
increases in transaction volumes also contributed to the gain in
trading transactions. Gross trading profits increased by 58.1%
or ¥14.4 billion to ¥39.1 billion ($364 million) due to increases in
product prices and a rise in transaction volumes. Net income
increased by 98.6% or ¥12.7 billion to ¥25.7 billion ($239 mil-
lion) as a result of the gain in gross trading profits, increases in
dividends received from LNG-related investments, and good
results at steel-product manufacturing associated company.
Identifiable assets in this segment increased by 10.7% or ¥47.3
billion to ¥491.0 billion ($4,572 million) as a result of a rise in
crude oil and petroleum product prices and a rise in operating
receivables stemming from greater overseas trade activity.
Chemicals, Forest Products & General Merchandise:
Trading transactions increased by 10.4% or ¥178.3 billion to
¥1,893.2 billion ($17,629 million) due to higher market prices for
chemical products and strength in the North American residential
housing market. Gross trading profits increased by 15.3% or
¥14.0 billion to ¥105.9 billion ($986 million) due to the strength in
chemical product market prices and the North American housing
market which boosted performance at residential housing mater-
ial-related subsidiaries. Net income increased by 75.6% or ¥8.7
billion to ¥20.3 billion ($188 million) as a result of the higher gross
trading profits. Identifiable assets in this segment increased by
4.7% or ¥26.4 billion to ¥583.7 billion ($5,435 million) on the back
of an increase in operating receivables in connection with the rise
in revenues cited above and the building out of inventories. 
Food:
Trading transactions fell by 9.9% or ¥233.2 billion to ¥2,111.9
billion ($19,666 million) as higher market prices for raw materi-
als used in foodstuffs and higher volumes among food distrib-
utor subsidiaries were not enough to offset the impact of a
reduction in low-efficiency transactions. Gross trading profits
increased by 4.0% or ¥5.2 billion to ¥136.2 billion ($1,268 mil-
lion) due to higher volumes among subsidiaries in food raw
materials and food distribution. Net income decreased by
¥22.6 billion resulting in a net loss of ¥9.3 billion ($86 million)
as gains from higher gross trading profits and larger income
from associated companies were offset by the impairment
loss on the equity method investment in FamilyMart.
Identifiable assets in this segment increased by 2.3% or ¥16.4
billion to ¥728.0 billion ($6,779 million) as the impact of the
impairment of the equity method investment cited above was
offset by additional investments, as well as, an increase in
operating receivables.

Trading transactions increased by 3.1% or ¥7.3 billion to
¥243.1 billion ($2,264 million) due to robust condo sales and
contributions from newly launched distribution-related opera-
tions. Gross trading profits increased by 146.3% or ¥23.4 bil-
lion to ¥39.3 billion ($366 million) on the back of strong condo
sales as well as decreases in losses on the disposal of residen-
tial property and valuation losses recorded as a result of a revi-
sion in the market values of inventories of real estate for sale in
