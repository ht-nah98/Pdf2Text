Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations
Fiscal 2005 was the final year of ITOCHU’s mid-term manage-
ment plan ‘Super A&P-2004’ (stands for “Attractive and
Powerful”), a two-year plan from fiscal 2004 through fiscal
2005. The year was positioned as the capstone to ITOCHU’s
A&P strategy as ITOCHU’s pace quickened to build a solid
foundation starting from fiscal 2006 for High Jump.

Analysis of Results of Operations for Fiscal 2005
Recognition of Goodwill Impairment Loss on FamilyMart
Stock
In fiscal 2005, the Company recognized a ¥45.1 billion (¥26.6
billion, after income tax) impairment loss on ITOCHU’s indirect
equity method investment in FamilyMart.
The loss represents the difference between the carrying
value of the investment in FamilyMart and estimated fair value.
The fair value was determined by the Company and its sub-
sidiaries using discounted cash flow analyses prepared by
third-party appraisers using the best-estimated future cash
flows available and by reference to the quoted market price of
FamilyMart’s publicly traded common stock.
Revenue:
From the previous fiscal year, the Company and its sub-
sidiaries have presented both revenue and its corresponding
cost for the fiscal year under review and the previous fiscal
years in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF)
Issue 99-19, “Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus
Net as an Agent” (EITF 99-19). EITF 99-19 requires that cer-
tain revenue transactions with corresponding cost of revenue
be presented on a gross basis when the company is the pri-
mary obligor in the arrangement, when the company has gen-
eral inventory risk before a customer order is placed or upon
customer return, or depending on relevant facts and circum-
stances of the transactions. Other than these transactions, the
company should recognize revenue on a net basis. In accor-
dance with EITF 99-19, the Company and its subsidiaries pre-
sent certain revenue transactions with corresponding cost of
revenues on a gross basis as “Sales revenue” in the consoli-
dated statements of operations, including sales of manufac-
turing, processing and service rendering, and sales with
general inventory risk before customer order. In fiscal 2005,
“Sales revenue” of ¥1,598.7 billion ($14,887 million) and
“Trading margins and commissions on trading transactions” of
¥392.6 billion ($3,655 million), totaling ¥1,991.2 billion
($18,542 million), increased by ¥252.5 billion or 14.5% from
the previous fiscal year. This was due to an expansion of trade
in natural resources in conjunction with a large hike in com-
modity prices for the minerals and energy markets, and a rise
in revenue from Machinery and forest products & general mer-
chandise-related sector in North America.
Gross trading profit:
Gross trading profit for fiscal 2005 increased by 13.5% or
¥74.9 billion from the previous year to ¥630.8 billion ($5,874
million). This marked a substantial turnaround in addition to end-
ing the downward trend that had continued since fiscal 2000. In
the previous fiscal year, ITOCHU booked losses on real estate
inventories of ¥20.2 billion. Excluding these extraordinary fac-
tors, this marked an increase of ¥54.7 billion in gross trading
profit on an adjusted basis. Of this, the impact from joining and
leaving subsidiaries was a ¥13.4 billion increase and a ¥3.9 bil-
lion decrease, respectively. The negative impact stemming from
the stronger yen in translating subsidiaries’ gross trading profit
was ¥5.9 billion. Excluding these increases and decreases;
there was a rise in profits for existing companies of ¥51.1 billion.
The increase was primarily attributed to: Textile, in which trade
grew due to the acquisition of new trading rights; Machinery,
which enjoyed favorable business in shipping trade, European
auto sales, and North American construction equipment busi-
ness; Energy, Metals & Minerals where the prices and trade vol-
ume of coal, iron ore, and crude oil increased; Chemicals,
Forest Products & General Merchandise, which enjoyed a high
market price for chemicals and solid trade in housing construc-
tion materials in North America; and Finance, Realty, Insurance
& Logistics Services, which recorded an increase in profits due
to its strong condominium sales.
