Liquidity and Capital Resources
Basic Policy for Funding
The Company aims to ensure flexibility so that it can quickly
respond to changes in the financial circumstances, and take
advantage of opportunities to lower its overall financing costs.
It also aims to diversify its funding sources and methods in
order to enhance the stability of its financing, while endeavor-
ing to find the optimum balance in its funding structure includ-
ing the improvement of the long-term funding balance. 
In Japan, most corporations still rely on indirect financing as
their primary source of funding with the largest percentage of
indirect financing coming from domestic banks. Most domes-
tic banks have adopted a positive earning expansion policy in
accordance with improved prospects over the disposal of bad
loans—a management issue for a number of years—as well as
the rebuilding of equity capital. In Company’s dealings with
them, these financial institutions appreciate Company’s
improved financial position and return to profitability. They
have shown a favorable attitude towards lending, and we
expect no difficulty in procuring funds through indirect financ-
ing. Moreover, as of the end of fiscal 2005, the Company had
obtained a rating for its long-term bonds of A from the
Japanese ratings institution JCR, Ba1 from the U.S. ratings
institution Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s), and BBB–
from Standard & Poor’s (S&P). On May 19, 2005, Moody’s
raised the Company’s rating to Baa3 from Ba1. All of the
Company’s ratings have become “Investment Grade”, and
better funding conditions are expected. In the future, aiming to
secure an even higher rating, the Company will make con-
certed efforts to improve Company’s financial position through
the continuation of high profitability and risk management.
With respect to bonds, the Company registers a bond
issuance every two years. In the two years from August 2003
to July 2005, a new issuance in the amount of ¥300 billion
was registered, enabling the flexible issuance of bonds.  
Under this issuance registration system, straight bonds
were issued in the amounts of ¥10 billion (with five-year matu-
rities) in August 2004, ¥10 billion (with three-year maturities) in
September, and ¥10 billion (with ten-year maturities) in
November, for a total of ¥30 billion. The outstanding balance
of bonds (excluding MTNs issued by the Company) was ¥250
billion ($2,326 million) as of March 31, 2005. 
Furthermore, the Company, ITOCHU International Inc. in the
U.S. and a finance subsidiary in the U.K. have registered a
total of $5 billion in a Medium Term Note Program (MTN) in
order to be flexible in fulfilling short and long-term funding
needs. The outstanding balance of the MTN was approxi-
mately $0.3 billion as of March 31, 2005. 
Interest-Bearing Debts
Interest-bearing debts as of March 31, 2005 decreased by
¥215.2 billion from the previous fiscal year to ¥2,346.7 billion
($21,852 million). As a result of the efforts to secure long-term
funds to provide the structure for stable fund-raising, the ratio
of long-term interest-bearing debts to total interest-bearing
debts increased to 71% from 65% at the end of fiscal 2004.
Moreover, the net DER (debt-to-equity ratio) improved by 1.0
to 3.7 times from 4.7 times at the end of fiscal 2004. Also, the
average interest rate of borrowing, or interest expenses,
divided by the average balance of interest-bearing debts,
improved by 16 basis points from 1.46% in fiscal 2004 to
1.30% in fiscal 2005.
