PROFILE
Founded in 1858 as an importer, exporter, and wholesaler of textiles, ITOCHU Corporation
has broadly expanded its business areas, adding plants, mineral resources, and IT products
and services to its traditional consumer-related businesses including textiles, food, and gen-
eral merchandise. At present, ITOCHU has become a more multifunctional business organi-
zation, adding investment, project management, and other functions to its conventional trad-
ing company operations.
In line with ITOCHU’s highly efficient profit structure and financial position gained through the
advancement of its A&P strategy, the Company has drawn up and implemented a new two-
year management plan that will shift its focus to a more offensive footing from fiscal year 2005. 
The new mid-term management plan “Frontier-2006: A Shift to Aggressive Business and
Enhancement of Solid Management” puts forth ITOCHU’s corporate vision of proactively
foreseeing social and market changes while consistently pursuing new frontiers. Under this
management plan, ITOCHU is aiming to become a high-profit corporate group earning over
¥100 billion in consolidated net income in a steady and sustainable manner by taking on the
comprehensive challenge of expanding earnings, creating new businesses, and enhancing
solid management including a further improvement of its financial position.
