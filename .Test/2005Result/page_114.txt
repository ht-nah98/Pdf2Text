million ($76 million), a decrease of ¥13,237 million and an
increase of ¥8,043 million, respectively.

sidiaries for which no deferred tax liability has been provided
aggregated ¥89,225 million ($831million) and ¥66,366 million

tributed earnings of domestic subsidiaries are not considered

tax laws. It is not practicable to determine the deferred tax lia-
bility for undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries.
