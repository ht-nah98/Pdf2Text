The New Mid-Term Management Plan, “Frontier-2006” (from April 2005 to March 2007)
Moving Toward “Aggressive” Management Based
on Our Achievements 
Due to the thorough implementation of the A&P
strategy, ITOCHU has built a business foundation
geared to sustained growth with a reformed profit
structure and an improved financial position. Going
forward, we aim to shift gears by adopting a more
aggressive approach to business to take on the
“challenge” of expanding earnings and to “create”
new businesses. We are also “committed” to adher-
ing to solid management, namely a further improve-
ment of our financial position and strengthening of
risk management capabilities, and evolving into a
highly profitable corporate group capable of stable
and consistent performance achieving more than
¥100 billion in net income. With these objectives, we
formulated our new mid-term management plan,
Frontier-2006.   
Summary of Frontier-2006
Frontier-2006, which is aimed at the two-year period from
the fiscal year ending March 2006, envisions a net income
of ¥110 billion in the final fiscal year of the plan. The plan
seeks to establish an earnings structure capable of con-
sistently generating more than ¥100 billion in net income,
irrespective of changes in the business environment.
In contrast to the A&P strategy in which we focused on
improving asset efficiency, Frontier-2006 seeks to
increase total assets while maintaining a highly-efficient
structure, reflecting our aggressive stance. Specifically,
the plan calls for an increase in investments of ¥200 billion
Numerical Plan and Summary
and an expansion of trade receivables by the fiscal year
ended March 2007, thereby raising total assets by ¥500
billion from the end of the term under review to a project-
ed ¥5 trillion. Meanwhile, solid management will also be
implemented through a reduction of net DER to a level
below 3.0 times by the end of the fiscal year ending
March 2007. Specifically, net interest-bearing debts will
increase from ¥1,891.1 billion at the end of the term
under review, but they will still be held to a level under
¥2,100 billion. The plan also expects an increase in stock-
holders’ equity of approximately ¥200 billion from the end
of the term under review due to the contribution of net
income.
