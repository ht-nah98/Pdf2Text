Selling, general and administrative expenses:
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by
0.9% or ¥3.9 billion from the previous fiscal year to ¥466.8 bil-
lion ($4,347 million). The impact from joining and leaving sub-
sidiaries was a ¥11.0 billion increase and a ¥3.9 billion
decrease, respectively, but the effect of the yen’s appreciation
against the U.S. dollar in translating overseas subsidiaries’
selling, general and administrative expenses was included for
approximately ¥3.5 billion. Excluding these factors, selling,
general and administrative expenses increased by ¥0.4 billion.
Expenses for pension plans improved dramatically to ¥19.3
billion (excluding liquidation losses and redemption balances
related to the settlement of a substantial portion of the
Employee’s Pension Fund the previous fiscal year totaling ¥3.2
billion). This resulted from a reduction of the projected benefit
obligation accompanying a restructuring of retirement pension
plans and a reduction in amortization costs such as actuarial
losses in accordance with the improvement in asset manage-
ment primarily arising from a strong domestic stock market.
On the other hand, expenses increased due to an expansion
of the operations of existing businesses in such areas as
increases in commissions paid, which included distribution
expenses (¥9.2 billion ($86 million) increase from the previous
fiscal year). Total selling, general and administrative expenses
therefore were ¥3.9 billion higher than the previous period.
Provision for doubtful receivables:
The amount of reversal of the provision for doubtful receivables
through collections of receivables decreased compared to the
previous fiscal year (approximately ¥3.2 billion ($30 million));
however, the provision for doubtful receivables improved by
41.8% or ¥4.4 billion from the previous fiscal year to ¥6.2 billion
($58 million), due to the recording of approximately ¥6.0 billion
in reserves for Construction and Realty in 2004.
Net financial expenses (Net of interest income, interest
expense, and dividends received):
Net financial expenses improved by 51.6% or ¥7.3 billion
from the previous fiscal year to ¥6.9 billion ($65 million). Net
interest expenses, consisting of interest income and interest
expense, improved by 15.0% or ¥3.7 billion to ¥21.0 billion.
Interest income decreased by 16.0% or ¥2.0 billion due to the
drop in interest rates and the collection of loans receivable.
Interest expense improved by 15.3% or ¥5.7 billion year-on-
year owing to the drop in interest rates (average interest rate
dropped by 0.16% from 1.46% to 1.30%) resulting in a
decrease of ¥4.1 billion and the decrease in interest-bearing
debts (average debts outstanding decreased by ¥113.9 billion
from ¥2,568.2 billion to ¥2,454.3 billion) resulting in a
decrease of ¥1.7 billion. 
Dividends received increased by 34.5% or ¥3.6 billion to
¥14.2 billion due to the increase in dividends received from
LNG-related investments and bank shares.
Other profit (loss):
Loss on disposal of investments and marketable securities,
including write-down increased by ¥11.8 billion from the pre-
vious fiscal year to a loss of ¥25.4 billion ($236 million).

sale of marketable securities from the listing of companies in
