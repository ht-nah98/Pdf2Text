Our Business Model, as Seen through Business Development
By utilizing financial and non-financial capital, focusing on fields where we can demon-
strate strengths, and creating multifaceted, linked businesses, we strive to enhance 
the earning power of our trade and business investment. By leveraging our business 
know-how and client and partner assets, we expand trade by creating added value 
and invest in fields where we have knowledge and can control risk. Amid rapid 
changes in the business environment, we are also strengthening our earnings base 
through timely strategic investments and continuous asset replacement for businesses 
that have passed their peak and / or are low-efficiency. Going forward, we will sustain 
value creation by maximizing synergies and upgrading our businesses through busi-
ness transformation that starts from downstream and is driven by market-oriented 
perspectives, while thoroughly instilling the “earn, cut, prevent” principles.

Responding to Changes in the Business Environment
We precisely assess changes in the business environment and execute cash recovery by business restructuring and exit-
ing from assets that have lost strategic significance from the viewpoint of asset efficiency and risk management. By rein-
vesting the recovered funds into new strategic areas, we are building a more robust earnings base.

Meeting Consumer and Social Needs
We will build a business model that caters to consumer and social needs by shifting to a downstream-centered market-
oriented perspective and by strengthening collaboration among Division Companies through breaking down product
