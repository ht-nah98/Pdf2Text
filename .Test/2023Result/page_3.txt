Key Points of Annual Report 2023
In compiling this annual report, ITOCHU focuses on three functions in 
 particular: (1) providing an in-depth understanding of its unique business 
model to a wide range of readers around the world, (2) effectively explain-
ing the processes and potential for ITOCHU to achieve sustainable growth 
in corporate value over the long term, and (3) clearly communicating the 
relationship between management strategies and financial and non-finan-
cial capital to internal and external stakeholders to foster the virtuous 
cycle of cultivating mutual understanding through dialogue and achieving 
a greater level of management sophistication for the Company.
  We have prepared Annual Report 2023 based on the aforementioned 
approach, and with reference to a disclosure framework for integrated 
reports. This year’s report places particular emphasis on 
our strategic focus and future orientation, connectivity, 
and consistency. Further, as in the past, we have used 
the “Corporate Value Calculation Formula*” to clearly 
establish the link between our management strategies 
and initiatives, and the enhancement of our corporate 
value. Please review this report as an account of our value creation story, 
which aims to achieve a balance between our “financial capital” and “non-
financial capital” based upon “Sampo-yoshi” as our corporate mission, 
and our business model evolution process in the current uncertain busi-
ness environment.

Key Points of Annual Report 2023
Annual Report 2023 continues to logically arrange information by using the established 
“Corporate Value Calculation Formula,” and the concept that the Chairman & CEO gives an 
overview of management strategies, while each officer explains the details of strategies 
focused on their area of responsibility. The report also aims to achieve the balance between 
“financial capital” and “non-financial capital” to ensure the sustainability of the Company, by 
featuring and explaining the process of self-transformation (polishing our existing business 
and new steppingstones for the future) of business models in the non-resource sector, which 
is the Company’s strength, and the human resource strategy that focuses on the most 
important management resource of general trading companies, “people,” particularly in the 
uncertain business environment including concerns over the economic downturn and geo-
political risks. Furthermore, the Annual Report has been created with the perspective explaining the “ITOCHU-ness” 
that constantly takes preemptive measures by sufficiently distinguishing between “things that should not be 
changed” and “things to change” in the era of transformation.

remain uncertain and unpredictable.
Identifying “things that should remain unchanged” and “things that should change” is important.

Key Points of Annual Report 2022
Annual Report 2022 used the “Corporate Value Calculation Formula” to logically organize 
the driving forces behind and initiatives implemented to enhance corporate value. Also, the 
Chairman & CEO provided an overview of management strategies and priority initiatives, 
while each officer explained the details of strategies focused on their area of responsibility. 
Furthermore, by providing examples of business model transformation, and explanations of 
the countermeasures for country risks and other risks, and our human resource strategy 
and governance that encompass the advancement of women, we sought to prepare an 
Annual Report that heightens trust in our management’s capabilities to respond to changes 
in the external environment.
