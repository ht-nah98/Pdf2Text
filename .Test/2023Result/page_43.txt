Sustainability Management
Through sustainability management that aligns with its various business activities, ITOCHU makes a concerted effort to 
address issues related to human rights, labor rights, and the environment in its supply chains and business investments.
■ Supply Chain Sustainability Survey
Prior to commencing business with a supplier, ITOCHU notifies all its suppliers of its Sustainability Action Guidelines for 
Supply Chains. After commencement of business, it conducts sustainability surveys every year as a means of enhancing 
communications about its sustainability policies.
  This survey contains questions based on the seven core subjects* of ISO26000 that must be answered. ITOCHU 
selects important suppliers based on guidelines regarding high-risk countries, handled products, and handled monetary 
amounts, for example. After obtaining answers to survey questions from these suppliers, sales representatives from each 
Division Company and sales representatives from overseas offices and Group companies meet with suppliers and con-
duct hearings (approximately 300 suppliers every year) based on their answers to the survey.
  Based on the outcomes of these interviews, if violations of the Sustainability Action Guidelines for Supply Chains 
are discovered and verified, the offending supplier is asked to take corrective action. At the same time, if deemed 
 necessary, the Company conducts an on-site inspection of the supplier and provides instructions while supporting 
their efforts to improve.
  By conducting these surveys and reviews, etc., ITOCHU aims to assess the state of affairs and to prevent problems 
from occurring.

■ Grievance Mechanism
We joined the general incorporated association Japan Center for Engagement and Remedy on Business and Human 
Rights (JaCER), which provides an Engagement and Remedy Platform in compliance with the United Nations “Guiding 
Principles on Business and Human Rights,” from 2022 onwards. JaCER accepts reports on cases that violate interna-
tional codes of conduct and national codes of conduct brought by all stakeholders in the supply chain, as well as cases 
of suspected violations, while securing the anonymity of whistleblowers and the confidentiality of reports. By accepting 
grievances through third-party channels, it ensures fairness and transparency in grievance handling and promotes 
engagement and remedies, contributing to the fundamental resolution of human rights issues.
■ Formulation of Procurement Policies for Individual Product Type
Based on the ITOCHU Group Sustainability Policy and Sustainability Action Guidelines for Supply Chains, ITOCHU endeav-
ors to sustainably procure raw materials and products. For the sake of responsible procurement, the Company has formu-
lated the following procurement policies for individual products and engages in activities based on these policies.

■ Human Rights Due Diligence
The ITOCHU Group is fulfilling its responsibility to respect human rights based on the ITOCHU Group Human Rights 
Policy established in April 2019. Specifically, we identify and evaluate the negative impact from the corporate activities of 
the ITOCHU Group on human rights that may affect society. We then work to prevent and mitigate such impact by taking 
the appropriate steps. With the cooperation of external experts, we have identified topics that each Division Company 
should focus on to prevent human rights risks in their business areas and also conducted risk mapping, referring to inter-
national guidelines and indicators such as SA8000.

Based on the risk mapping by business area, we are 
working on human rights due diligence and have identified 
clothing, textiles, footwear, cotton, carpets, yarns, bags, 
etc. in the Textile Company as the subject to be investi-
gated for FYE 2023, and have disclosed the results of 
human rights due diligence. There were no issues identi-
fied as human rights issues that have already occurred or 
are immediately of concern, but regarding the confirmed 
issues, we engage with suppliers through interviews, 
additional survey questionnaires, etc., and discuss and 
request corrective actions regarding future response poli-
cies. We also follow up on progress in our supply chain 
sustainability surveys conducted every year. In FYE 2024, 
we are conducting human rights due diligence for the 
General Products & Realty Company and plan to imple-
ment this in other business fields in the future.
