Special Feature 2: Polishing Our Existing Business and New Steppingstones
Polishing Value Chain, Starting with FamilyMart and 
Steppingstones for Further Growth
In the convenience store business starting with FamilyMart, ITOCHU Group companies are collaborating to build and 
strengthen value chains that extend from downstream to upstream areas. These collaborative initiatives are not limited 
to procuring high-value-added food products and their ingredients but also help increase the appeal of a wide range of 
products. For example, collaborative initiatives are contributing to the rollouts of the new “FAMIMARU” private brand for 
daily necessities and Convenience Wear apparel, which features differentiated designs. In many different fields, ITOCHU 
is leveraging its business foundations to transcend Division Company boundaries and enhance entire value chains. These 
efforts include strengthening efficient and stable logistics functions, building systems, and providing construction materi-
als. As for new steppingstones aimed at sustained growth, The 8th Company is actively engaged in collaborative efforts 
to create new earnings sources, including advertising, media, and finance businesses.

“Steppingstones” for Further Growth
Expansion of New Businesses by 
Leveraging Foundations
In new businesses, ITOCHU is accelerating 
the realization of profits by using stores as 
media through the installation of digital signage, 
by creating digital advertising businesses that 
leverages physical stores, and by strengthening 
finance businesses that utilize the “Famipay” 
app. Through the combination of digital 
media—including digital signage, apps, and 
digital advertising—as well as the fusion of 
 digital and real, we aim to provide further 
value to our customers.
Reinforcement of the Foundations of 
the Convenience Store Business
We will provide superior customer experience 
value and enhance store profitability by fostering 
the new “FAMIMARU” private brand, developing 
more signature products, pursuing brand value 
enhancement that includes the strengthening of 
mainstay products, and expanding the customer 
base through stepped-up marketing approach 
based on the “Famipay” app and customer data 
analysis. In addition, by lowering store operating 
costs through utilizing new technologies such as 
AI to reduce manpower, we aim to expand and 
enhance store infrastructure.
