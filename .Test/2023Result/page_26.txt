FYE 2024 Management Plan
In FYE 2024, the final year of “Brand-new Deal 2023,” Japan’s economy is expected to recover to a certain degree due 
to such factors as continuing low interest rates, wage rises and higher consumer spending, and an increase in demand 
from visitors to Japan. Overseas, however, the business environment is expected to remain extremely uncertain, with 
concerns about downward pressure on the global economy being caused by such factors as an economic slowdown 
due to further inflation and the persistently high interest rate level that is resulting from the monetary tightening policies 
being pursued mainly by major North American and European central banks, the slow pace of economic recovery in 
China due to sluggish export growth, etc., and uncertainty over geopolitical risks, including the unresolved Russia–
Ukraine situation. In this business environment, ITOCHU will realize sustained enhancement of corporate value by 
 stepping up measures in line with its basic  policies of “Realizing business transformation by shifting to a market-oriented 
perspective” and “Enhancing our contribution to and engagement with the SDGs through business activities.”
