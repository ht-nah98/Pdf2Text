Specific Example of Realizing Business Transformation by Shifting to a Market-Oriented Perspective  
Acquisition of North American Engineered Wood Products (Posts and Beams) Business
Pacific Woodtech Corporation acquired the engineered wood products (posts and beams) manufacturing business in North America. 
With the acquisition of the business, three manufacturing plants in California and North Carolina in the United States, and British 
Columbia in Canada have been added, the company established engineered wood product manufacturing capabilities that cover the 
whole of North America. With its reinforced manufacturing capabilities, the company is focusing on the decking market, where further 
market growth is expected, and has begun the development and sales of structural materials for decking in addition to existing applica-
tions for engineered wood products. Following on from initiatives in our fence business, we will continue to increase the resilience of the 
value chain in the engineered wood products business with a view to further strengthening the earnings base of our North American 
construction materials business.
