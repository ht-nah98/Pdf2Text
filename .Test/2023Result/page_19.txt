Key Issues Based on the Results of the Engagement Survey
Implementation of measures
Fostering job satisfaction among junior and 
mid-career employees
Evolution of the Morning- 
Focused Working System
Respect for the individuals
•  Providing opportunities for independent career building and 
•  Introducing the Morning-Focused Flextime System  
further growth
(Introduced in FYE 2023)
•  Remuneration and evaluation based on accomplishments, 
•  Applying the work from home system to all employees 
and feedback that leads to growth
(introduced in FYE 2023)
Sharing personnel and ideas beyond  
the boundaries of organizations
•  Promoting the smooth transfer of personnel
•  Encouraging employees to take up further challenges
Responding to diverse values 
Supporting junior and 
mid-career employees
Opportunity for growth
•  Amending the human resource system based on the follow-
ing (plan to introduce in FYE 2025) 
(1) Providing Evaluation and Compensation Commensurate with 
Results (such as competitive compensation levels in recruitment) 
(2) Supporting Employee-Led Career Development (A multi-
faceted career support for balancing childcare, nursing care, 
illness, etc., and, continuous  re-education and re-skilling)
Supporting the  
advancement of female  
employees
Diversity
•  Reviewing uniform careers 
•  Offering greater options in relation to flexible work styles 
•  Monitoring of and individual support for the promotion and 
development of female employees
suited to diversified values, and types of work and lifestyles
•  Support for career continuation in consideration of life events
We regularly conduct engagement surveys to capture 
employee feedback on the company, organization,  
systems, etc., in order to utilize it for future personnel 
measures and beyond. Taking the results into consider-
ation, we review human resource strategies, and decide 
on countermeasures to issues at the Executive 
Committee. In fiscal years when we do not conduct 
engagement  surveys, we conduct simplified surveys with 
carefully selected questions to swiftly and accurately 
assess progress on these measures, report the identified 
issues, etc. to the Executive Committee, and decide on 
new measures and improvements. In this way, we assess 
issues every year and conduct PDCA cycles to promote 
human resource strategies and make improvements.
In the engagement survey conducted in FYE 2022, we 
continued to receive a high level of positive responses. 
Compared with FYE 2019, however, there was a decrease 
in the figures in cultivation (engagement). After analyzing 
the factors, we recognized the need to respond to the 
diverse values of junior and female employees in particular. 
Therefore, as the second stage of work-style reforms  
starting from FYE 2023, we evolved the Morning-Focused 
Working System and introduced the Morning-Focused 
Flextime System and the work from home system (avail-
able to all employees). Recognizing support for junior and 
mid-career employees and female employees as an 
issue, ITOCHU will continue implementing various initia-
tives, such as support for career continuation in consider-
ation of life events. By adhering these measures, ITOCHU 
will work to further enhance corporate value.
