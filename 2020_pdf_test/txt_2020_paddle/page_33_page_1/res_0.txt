Coordination In addition to the traditional functions of a general trading company, we aim to leverage client and partner assets to find optimal way of sales and cultivate sales routes and procure- ment partners as we respond to various customer needs and strive to expand trade. Promoting Business Management In addition to leveraging the various functions and manage- ment know-how we have accumulated as a general trading company, we take the initiative in forming business combina- tions and alliances with Group companies, enhancing the competitive advantage of our investees. Generating Synergies among Businesses By leveraging the Group's management resources, we maximize synergies between existing businesses and Group companies, increasing the Group's overall corporate value.</td><td>Asset Strategies With the strategic importance of business investment increas- ing, we have developed and are steadily implementing asset strategies that emphasize investment in areas of strength, thorough risk management, and the pursuit of asset efficiency. Investing in Areas of Strength We emphasize investment in areas where we have strength, such as the non-resource sector, centered on consumer- related businesses, and in China and other parts of Asia. On this basis, we are working to further reinforce our com- petitive edge. Risk Management In addition to managing total amount of risk by utilizing risk assets, we are also conducting risk management on a project-by-project basis through evaluation of investment efi- ciency using a hurdle rate based on the cost of capital. In this manner, we also work to analyze and control the various risks surrounding our businesses. Pursuing Asset Efficiency We exit from investments that are determined to be low- efficiency assets from such perspectives as scale of earnings, investment eficiency, and strategic significance. In this way. we are working to maximize free cash flows by increasing asset efficiency and strengthening cash generation power.</td></tr></table></body></html>"}, "img_idx": 0}
