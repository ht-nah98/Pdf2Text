Driving Force for Sustainable Value Creation 
The Story of Merchants
More than 160 years have passed since ITOCHU’s establishment in 1858. Like our founder, Chubei Itoh I, 
who crossed rugged mountain passes and paved the ways for peddling his wares throughout Japan, we have 
overcome numerous difficulties during the ensuing years. Despite these difficulties we have remained true 
to our identity as a merchant, “supplying the needs of the society,” as well as to the business philosophy of 
Chubei Itoh I, “Sampo-yoshi.” This identity and philosophy have constantly underscored our actions and 
served as the driving force for transforming ourselves.

ITOCHU’s Major Milestones
1858
Founded 
Chubei Itoh I commenced linen trading 
 operations via Osaka in Senshu and Kishu. 
1950s–1960s 
Internationalization and 
Diversification 
1970s
Move into Resource Development 
and Space Development 
1980s
Aggressive Promotion of  
Telecommunications Business  
We pursued a path of diversification,  
and as a result non-textile areas accounted 
for around 40% of trading volume (1958). 
In the 1960s, we expanded our business 
to include energy, machinery, general 
 merchandise projects, and the iron and 
steel business, becoming a “¥1 trillion 
trading company.”
While we set our policy of aggressive 
 expansion into such areas as space devel-
opment, ocean development, and overseas 
resource development, we returned to the 
Chinese market prior to the normalization 
of diplomatic relations between Japan and 
China. In 1977, we expanded the iron and 
steel business through a merger with Ataka 
& Co., Ltd.
As yen appreciation became a fixture of 
the economy, we promoted international-
ization and globalization. We moved 
 aggressively into the ICT field and entered 
the satellite business.

“Unless you deliver  
what is needed,  
you will never grow.”
“Reliable, fast,  
simple, and clear”
“Trade is a compassionate 
business. It is noble when 
it accords with the spirit of 
Buddha by profiting those 
who sell and those who 
buy and supplying the 
needs of the society.”
Uichiro Kosuga
1949–1960
“ITOCHU’s management 
policy is to maintain  
a family-like community 
that shares what little  
it has.”
