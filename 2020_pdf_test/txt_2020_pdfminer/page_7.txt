Concept for Annual Report 2020
Sustainably Enhancing 
Corporate Value by Steadfastly Upholding 
Our Unwavering Ideal, “Sampo-yoshi” 
Taking “inherited strengths” and the “earn, cut, prevent” principles as our driving force, we will realize our 
short-term targets, lay steppingstones for medium- to long-term value creation, and maintain the initiatives 
and systems supporting sustainable growth. Rather than choosing “a single expedient,” we will unflaggingly 
pursue “all the priorities” — this is the approach for sustainable increase in corporate value (total capital) as 
merchants upholding unwavering ideal of “Sampo-yoshi.”
