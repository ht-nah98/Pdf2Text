FYE 2021 Management Plan
Concept of FYE 2021 Management Plan
The business environment is undergoing tumultuous changes. We are poised to move into a new management phase in which we must 
be prepared for economic downturn and global recession.
Accomplished and completed the measures set out in our medium-term management plan, “Brand-new Deal 2020,” ahead of schedule 
during FYE 2019 and FYE 2020.
Setting FYE 2021 as a year for consolidating our foothold, we formulated a single-year management plan.
