Division Companies
From its original business of textiles, ITOCHU has expanded its areas of opera-
tions to include natural resource development, machinery, foods, consumer-
related businesses, and financial services. At the same time, it has developed 
an integrated business structure that encompasses not only trading but also
investment and project organization. 
Based on the Division Company System introduced in April 1997, ITOCHU has
seven Division Companies. The aim of this system is to maximize revenue and
earnings in each field of business through a swift decision-making process. 
In addition, we are working to maximize the earnings of the entire Group
through the horizontal integration of projects spanning the Division Companies
and in close cooperation with ITOCHU Headquarters.
