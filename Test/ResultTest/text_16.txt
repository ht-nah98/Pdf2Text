The Corporate Planning & Administration Division, the Corporate
Communications Division, the Investor Relations Department, the
IT Planning Division, the Affiliate Administration Division, and the
International Operations Division, headed by the Chief Corporate
Planning Officer, formulate company-wide management plans and
support strategic initiatives. Under Frontier+ 2008, these divisions and
department promote ITOCHU’s global strategic development through
cooperation with administrative divisions at the Headquarters.
Planning and promoting company-wide management plans
Company-wide management plans are primarily formulated by the
Corporate Planning & Administration Division, which also gives guidance
and directives for strategic execution under the management plans of all
Division Companies’ planning and coordinating departments. Acting as
the control tower for the entire ITOCHU Group, the division is also
responsible for allocating management resources, monitoring progress
relative to plans, evaluating performance, and coordinating and moni-
toring Group business strategies.
Supporting strategic pursuits
The Corporate Communications Division and the Investor Relations
Department provide lateral strategic support through external and internal
communications. The IT Planning Division formulates IT strategies and
constructs the IT infrastructure, supporting ITOCHU’s global development
in terms of information systems. Practical support for each Division
Company’s and operating company’s strategic pursuits is provided by
the Affiliate Administration Division in Japan and by the International
Operations Division overseas. The International Operations Division
also works with the Human Resources Division to “cultivate global human
resources” overseas and “accelerate global business development” under
Frontier+ 2008.
