Specific Example of Enhancing Our Contribution to and Engagement with the SDGs  
Acquisition of a Partial Interest in an Iron Ore Project in Canada (AMMC)
Through ITOCHU Minerals & Energy of Australia Pty Ltd, ITOCHU has acquired a partial interest in the AMMC iron ore project in Canada, which 
is operated by the major steel companies ArcelorMittal of Europe, Posco Holdings Inc. of South Korea, and China Steel Corporation of Taiwan.
  AMMC has a steady output of 25 million tons of iron ore and pellets annually, and conducts integrated operations through its owner-
ship of mines, railway, a port, and pellet production facilities in eastern Quebec, Canada. The high-grade iron ore produced by AMMC is 
an essential raw material for direct reduced iron (DRI), which contributes to lower carbon emissions of the steel industry.
In addressing the need to respond to climate change, we have added this interest to our existing portfolio of iron ore businesses to 
strengthen our ability to provide stable supplies of high-grade iron ore, which is seeing increasing demand worldwide. Together with its 
partners, ITOCHU will continue to contribute to reducing carbon emissions of the steel industry.

FYE 2023 Review (Specific Accomplishments)
Invested in the AMMC iron ore project in Canada to secure stable supply of high-grade iron ore that helps reduce carbon 
emissions of the steel industry
Sought to expand our business platform for the next generation by steadily advancing the development of the Allegheny 
coking coal mine in the United States and concluding an agreement on the acquisition of a partial interest in the Fitzroy 
coking coal project in Australia
Became the first company in Japan to procure and sell environment-friendly raw materials for aluminum produced through 
the use of solar power
Began the full-scale operation of U.S. company GE Digital’s operation and asset management efficiency improvement 
system, which contributes to the promotion of digitalization, at the iron ore mine of CSN Mineração S.A. in Brazil
Growth Opportunities (Sustainable Growth)
Growth Rate
Increasing interests in and realizing stable supplies of metal resources, which underpin the base of economic activities and 
are indispensable for the transition to a decarbonized society
Leveraging our solid relationships with steel manufacturers and power companies to strengthen our initiatives related to 
DRI and other low-carbon raw materials that help realize a decarbonized society, CCUS projects, emissions rights, and 
hydrogen and ammonia projects
Steadily promoting initiatives for “venous industries” (industries where wastes are turned into reusable resources) to help 
build a circular economy, that entails recycling and appropriate waste treatment
Developing businesses that respond to structural changes in society, such as EVs and FCVs, energy storage systems 
(ESS), and lighter-weight materials that improve energy efficiency
Risk Responses (Lower Cost of Capital)
Cost of Capital
Pursuing efforts to completely withdraw from thermal coal mine investments and promoting technological development that 
contributes to GHG emissions reductions
Promoting businesses that facilitate weight reduction of vehicles and EVs (including wider use of aluminum, rare metals, 
and other materials)
Optimizing our asset portfolio to support stable supply of raw materials and fuels to meet social needs
Complying with our Environment, Health, and Safety (EHS) Guidelines, continuing employee education on these Guidelines, 
and contributing to local communities where we do business through the provision of healthcare, education, donations, 
and assistance in the establishment of regional infrastructure
Promoting increases in efficiency through mining operations and facility management utilizing digital transformation, and 
conversion to automated operation of mining equipment
