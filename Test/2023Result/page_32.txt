Exit Criteria for Business Investment
■ Enhancing the Corporate Value of Group Companies
(1) Cumulative losses for the last three years
(2) Returns lower than original plans made at the time of investment
(3)  Cumulative losses in added value for the last three years 
[Consolidated contribution*1 – (Consolidated investment carrying amount x Cost of capital*2)]
*1  Consolidated contribution: The total of net profit and trade merit
*2  Cost of capital: Set according to industry (approximately 70) and country
ITOCHU enhances the corporate value of Group companies by rigorously implementing the “earn, cut, prevent” princi-
ples and strengthening monitoring, which is based on various types of assessments. For example, we steadily accumu-
late high-quality assets by conducting qualitative and quantitative verifications that consider synergies in assessing 
investment efficiency and the strategic significance and earnings scale of business investments. Moreover, in relation to 
concern over possible future losses, at an early stage, we evaluate investments and take appropriate measures by con-
sistently applying conservative premises both for credit management and evaluations of the recoverability of various types 
of assets. Thanks to these activities, we have built a robust earnings base that is diversified across a wide range of busi-
ness areas mainly in the non-resource sector. Even in an uncertain business environment, the ratio of Group companies 
reporting profits remains at the high level of approximately 90%.

■ The Four Lessons for Investments
ITOCHU has compiled the lessons learned from past investment failures as “the Four Lessons for Investments” and 
repeatedly shares the lesson through training sessions based on cases of investment failures and at various management 
meetings throughout the whole company. In this way, we ensure that the lessons are kept in mind when investment proj-
ects are being considered in frontline operations. “The Four Lessons for Investments” are as follows.
The Four Lessons for Investments (To Rigorously Prevent Below)
(1) Overpaying for investments
•  Make investments at a low price to minimize future risk of impairment loss
(2)  Investments aimed at  seizing 
•  Avoid shortsighted investments in a field or area with limited insight that only target current 
profit from investees
profit contributions
(3)  Overdependence on and 
 overconfidence in partners
(4)  Lack of hands-on management
•  Do not engage in projects where ITOCHU must rely on partners or sales from the specific 
customers
•  Do not engage in projects where ITOCHU cannot seize management control or take 
the initiative
Training sessions based on cases of investment failures aim to understand the essence of past investment failures so that 
we avoid repeating the mistakes that led to them. The Global Risk Management Division prepares training materials 
based on interviews with relevant parties regarding the decision-making process at the time of investment and regarding 
discussions at the DMC*1 and the HMC*2. In FYE 2023, the training sessions included five specific examples, such as 
points to keep in mind in relation to projects purchased from investment funds or introduced by investment banks and 
examples of failures in overseas business investment. In the past, only mid-career employees participated in the training 
sessions. Beginning from FYE 2023, however, the scope was expanded to all employees, and a large number of employ-
ees participated in each training session. Through training sessions based on cases of investment failures, we will con-
tinue to utilize the lessons learned from the past in investment decisions and monitoring. In this way, we will strengthen 
and increase the rigor of measures that “prevent” the occurrence of unforeseen impairment losses, thereby heightening 
the success rate of investments.
