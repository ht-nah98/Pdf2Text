Logic Tree 
(Strategic Framework for Growth in Non-Financial Capital and Corporate Value)
■  Maintaining and Upgrading of Non-Financial Capital and Its Relationship to  
■ ITOCHU’s Logic Tree for Building Up Corporate Value
Material Issues
ITOCHU analyzes the magnitude of opportunities to increase its non-financial 
capital as well as the magnitude of risks with the potential to damage such 
capital. Based on its findings, the Company identifies as its material issues 
those social issues that require prioritized and proactive initiatives by the 
Company. We then set out to resolve the identified material issues through 
business operations. By leveraging trust and creditworthiness garnered over 
many years, we will maintain and further grow our non-financial capital.

Medium-term management plan “Brand-new Deal 2023” establishes further strengthening of our robust earnings base cen-
tered on the non-resource sector as a goal and sets a long-term target for reducing GHG emissions. We are steadily advanc-
ing initiatives to reach this goal and target. In addition, in FYE 2024, the last year of “Brand-new Deal 2023,” the management 
plan sets short-term targets based on updated quantitative targets. We set a succession of short-term targets to provide 
milestones for our climb toward medium- to long-term targets. Through commitment-based management that emphasizes 
the steady achievement of targets in all time frames, we will realize sustained, sure-footed growth in corporate value.
