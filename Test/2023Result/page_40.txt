Initiatives to Promote Sustainability
■ Sustainability Promotion Flow
■ Identification Process for Material Issues and Incorporation into Action Plans
Under the ITOCHU Group Sustainability Policy, which was established in accordance with ITOCHU’s corporate mission 
and changes in the external environment, the Company promotes sustainability initiatives systematically throughout 
its organization. Of particular note, each Division Company and administrative division incorporates ITOCHU’s material 
issues, which are identified as issues to be addressed with priority, into Sustainability Action Plans. We will continue to 
sustainably enhance corporate value and resolve social issues at the same time through our business  activities, namely 
trade and business investment, while ensuring that we maintain and improve profitability.

New Facilities Opened at the ITOCHU SDGs STUDIO
In July 2022, ITOCHU opened the ITOCHU SDGs STUDIO KIDS PARK. Designed for 
both parents and children, this facility allows children, who will lead the future, to expe-
rience our concept of the SDGs through play. This free facility where kids can safely 
play is garnering attention as the 300 reservation slots for each day are always filled. 
As of March 31, 2023, around 50,000 people had visited the facility.
  Furthermore, in July 2023, we opened the ITOCHU SDGs STUDIO RESTAURANT 
Hoshi no Kitchen, a restaurant that provides a “delicious, enjoyable, and sustainable” 
dining experience. Featuring classic dishes loved by everyone from children to adults 
made with food ingredients including those which are handled by ITOCHU Group 
companies such as Dole and FUJI OIL CO., LTD., etc., the restaurant allows visitors to 
casually experience sustainable food initiatives.
  Going forward, at the ITOCHU SDGs STUDIO, by enhancing contact points with 
children and consumers, we will continue providing opportunities to interact with and 
learn about various SDGs.
Since ITOCHU first identified its material issues in FYE 2014, the Company has been continuously reviewing them based on 
trends in the international community and the expectations of stakeholders. In FYE 2019, we revised our material issues by 
further reflecting ESG perspectives and incorporating elements from health management and the consumer sector, which 
are our fields of strength. By incorporating material issues into business operations, our revised material issues have 
become better suited to helping achieve the Paris Agreement and the SDGs adopted by the United Nations.
  Furthermore, as a specific initiative, each Division Company and administrative division incorporates the identified material 
issues into Sustainability Action Plans for each business field. First, each organization identifies risks and opportunities and 
social impacts in each business field, and then sets medium- to long-term targets, draws up action plans with measures 
and performance indicators for achieving these targets, reviews progress, and finally reports achievements to the 
Sustainability Committee, with the intention of making steady progress through a PDCA cycle.
