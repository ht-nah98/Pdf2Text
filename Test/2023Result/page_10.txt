A Value Creation Model Centered on “Sampo-yoshi”
In enhancing corporate value, we must use capital and our four strengths to drive the growth of our economic value and 
environmental / social value. Specifically, we are working to expand created value (Achievement of Short-Term Targets), 
increase the growth rate (Steppingstones to Medium- to Long-Term Value Creation), and lower the cost of capital 
(Initiatives and Systems Supporting Sustainable Growth). As a result, we will continue realizing a virtuous cycle that 
 further reinforces capital and our four strengths, which are the driving forces for sustainable value creation.

What is ITOCHU focusing on?
To enhance corporate value, we aim to expand created value, increase growth rate, and lower 
cost of capital. We are therefore conducting management with a focus on the following points.
Enhancement of Corporate Value 
Expand Created Value 
“Sampo-yoshi,” “Earn, Cut, Prevent,” and 
Commitment-Based Management
Building a Track Record, Enhancing Our Trust and 
Creditworthiness
We will promote our management strategies and policies with 
speed and flexibility, while always keeping in mind our corpo-
rate mission of “Sampo-yoshi” and “Earn, Cut, Prevent.” 
Through our unwavering practice of commitment-based 
management where we deliver on our promises, we will 
achieve sustained value creation.
We will build a track record by continuously and soundly 
achieving our short-term goals. We will attain sustained value 
creation by leveraging our track record to further enhance our 
trust and creditworthiness.

Focusing on Fields and Sectors Where We Can 
Demonstrate Our Strengths
Preparations with Foresight 
In order to adapt to the volatile business environment and 
diversifying consumer needs, we will achieve sustained value 
creation by steadily laying the steppingstones in fields and 
sectors where we can demonstrate our strengths.
While mitigating future risks early based on the PEST analysis 
as well as other factors, we will continuously review our 
structure including for corporate governance, thereby achiev-
ing sustained value enhancement.
