Specific Example of Enhancing Our Contribution to and Engagement with the SDGs  
ista Energija d.o.o., in which ITOCHU has invested through I-ENVIRONMENT INVESTMENTS LIMITED in the United Kingdom, is 
Solving Complex and Interlinked Environmental, Decarbonization, Waste Management, and Energy 
Conversion Problems through Business
Beo 
engaged in an integrated Energy-from-Waste business in Belgrade, the capital of the Republic of Serbia. The company has already 
begun providing certain services, including the operation of managed landfill sites and construction demolition waste recycling. Once the 
Energy-from-Waste facility is completed, the company will begin supplying clean electricity and heat to up to 10% of the households in 
the metropolitan area of the Republic of Serbia in 2023. The business will make a multifaceted contribution to the achievement of the 
SDGs. In addition to addressing the country’s long-standing environmental and waste problems, the business will help realize energy 
conversion, decarbonization, and European Union accession, which are high priority national policies. ITOCHU will continue to help 
address social issues by leveraging its accumulated expertise and competence in the development, design, construction, and operation 
of businesses to realize high-value-added infrastructure projects.
