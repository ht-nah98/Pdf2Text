■ Toward Establishment of a Robust Earnings Base
In FYE 2023, we achieved consolidated net profit of more than ¥800.0 billion for the second consecutive year by further 
growing our core profit in the non-resource sector through augmentation of existing strengths and the steady stepping 
up of our performance. 
  Currently, while COVID-19 pandemic-related restrictions were lifted in Japan, the business environment is becoming 
increasingly unpredictable due to the continuation of a mix of multiple causes for uncertainty, including geopolitical risks, 
such as the unresolved Russia–Ukraine situation, concerns about an economic slowdown due to persistently high inter-
est rate levels and further inflation, which are centered on North America and Europe, and foreign exchange rate volatility. 
Responding flexibly to changes in this business environment by utilizing our accumulated four strengths as the driving 
forces, we will both envision the next profit stage to the consolidated net profit at the ¥800.0 billion level and seek further 
dramatic advances by rigorously applying the “earn, cut, prevent” principles again that serve as our business fundamen-
tals and by building a robust  earnings base through steadily laying the steppingstones.
Virtuous Cycle That Increases the Sustainability of Strengths
Overcoming numerous adversities during a history spanning more than 160 years, we have built up four strengths, which 
have become more sustainable by interacting with each other while growing together as part of a virtuous cycle. Going 
forward, we will augment these four strengths even further and sustainably enhance corporate value through continuous 
self-transformation in step with the emerging trends and currents in society.

Individual Capabilities
Since its founding, ITOCHU has focused on businesses in the non-resource sector, where we have established many 
customer contact points. As a result, we have developed a strong frontline presence that makes us keenly alert to 
the constant changes in consumer needs and enhances our individual capabilities.
Comprehensive Strength
Capabilities of the Organization and  
Business Know-How
Supported by a corporate culture that encourages constant awareness of our “Sampo-yoshi” corporate mission, 
business divisions and administrative divisions work as a team to fully realize the individual capabilities of employees 
in the development of businesses, thereby building up both the capabilities of the organization and business 
know-how.
Comprehensive Strength 
Business Portfolio
Our individual capabilities that accompany a strong frontline presence, together with the accumulated capabilities of 
the organization and business know-how, enable the flexible combinations of internal capital in response to social 
changes and continuous self-transformation.
Earning Power  
in the Non-Resource Sector
Experience and Track Record  
in China and Other Parts of Asia
Through continuous self-transformation, we avoid the obsolescence of existing businesses and steadily seize new 
business opportunities. In this way, we increase our strengths, namely, our “earning power in the non-resource 
sector” and our “experience and track record in China and other parts of Asia.” Increasing these strengths create  
further business opportunities and bolsters individual capabilities while enabling the sustained enhancement of all the 
strengths we have accumulated.
