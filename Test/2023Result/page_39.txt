PEST Analysis (Macroenvironmental Factors through 2030)
Political/Legal
Economical
Social/Cultural
Technological
The ITOCHU Group’s business environment is changing, and uncertainties are increasing. Through PEST analysis, we 
fully assess risks and opportunities in the context of macroenvironmental factors—such as economic recession risks, 
geopolitical risks, and responses to the SDGs—and build an even stronger competitive edge by implementing flexible 
measures and transforming businesses in response to changes in the times and the business environment.

In the graph for each macroenvironmental factor, the upper part represents our view of the balance between the degrees of impact of risks 
and opportunities, while the lower part represents our projection of changes in the degrees of impact through 2030. It also identifies the 
related non-financial capital (NFC).
Change in Investment Environment — Related NFC:  Business Know-How   Business Portfolio   Natural Resources

Increase in expected returns as growth rebounds;  
more investment opportunities in fields and regions of strength
Change in Investment Environment
Balance of risks and opportunities
Long-term trend through 2030
Short-term
Medium-term
Long-term
Example: Change in Investment Environment
This represents instances where the effect of opportu-
nity is greater than that of risk, and the degree of effect 
(investment opportunity) is expected to increase over 
the near- to medium-term, despite uncertainty. 
Moreover, this represents instances where the long-
term outlook is difficult to predict.

With the actualization of geopolitical risks, policies focus more on ongoing international cooperation as well as the stability of  
citizens’  livelihoods. We will develop businesses amid the demand for appropriate corporate responses.
With economic growth of developed countries slowing as populations level off and the gap in economic growth potential widening among 
emerging countries, we will determine the correct balance between growth fields and fields that will peak out.
