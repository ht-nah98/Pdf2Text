The ITOCHU Group’s business environment is changing, and uncertainties are increasing. Through PEST analysis, we 
fully assess risks and opportunities in the context of macroenvironmental factors—such as economic recession risks, 
geopolitical risks, and responses to the SDGs—and build an even stronger competitive edge by implementing flexible 
measures and transforming businesses in response to changes in the times and the business environment.

E
Stagnation of the Global Economy — Related NFC:  Business Know-How   Business Portfolio   Client and Partner Assets
Risks
Opportunities
Decrease in business opportunities and trade volume
Emergence of new demand from changes in  
consumer and corporate behavior
Greater Disparity in Economic Growth among Emerging Countries — Related NFC:  Human and Organizational Capital   Business Portfolio   Client and Partner Assets
Emergence of non-performing assets due to  
economic and social deterioration
In the global south, increase in consumer spending as standard of 
living improves and increase in demand for infrastructure and  
food resources as population grows
Dollar Appreciation — Related NFC:  Business Know-How   Business Portfolio
Depreciation in currencies of emerging countries;  
increase in overseas investment costs
Appreciation in value of assets denominated in foreign currencies 
and expansion of businesses that benefit from yen depreciation
Volatility in Asset (Stocks, Real Estate) and Resource Prices — Related NFC:  Business Portfolio   Client and Partner Assets   Natural Resources
Formation and collapse of asset bubbles in  
specific fields and products
Growth in earnings from trading and increase in

In the graph for each macroenvironmental factor, the upper part represents our view of the balance between the degrees of impact of risks 
and opportunities, while the lower part represents our projection of changes in the degrees of impact through 2030. It also identifies the 
related non-financial capital (NFC).
Change in Investment Environment — Related NFC:  Business Know-How   Business Portfolio   Natural Resources
Excessive swings in project value
Increase in expected returns as growth rebounds;  
more investment opportunities in fields and regions of strength
Change in Investment Environment
Balance of risks and opportunities
Long-term trend through 2030
Short-term
Medium-term
Long-term
Example: Change in Investment Environment
This represents instances where the effect of opportu-
nity is greater than that of risk, and the degree of effect 
(investment opportunity) is expected to increase over 
the near- to medium-term, despite uncertainty. 
Moreover, this represents instances where the long-
term outlook is difficult to predict.

(wind, solar, hydrogen, ammonia, etc.)
Generation of new sales channels through  
introduction of new taxes

With the actualization of geopolitical risks, policies focus more on ongoing international cooperation as well as the stability of  
citizens’  livelihoods. We will develop businesses amid the demand for appropriate corporate responses.
With economic growth of developed countries slowing as populations level off and the gap in economic growth potential widening among 
emerging countries, we will determine the correct balance between growth fields and fields that will peak out.
