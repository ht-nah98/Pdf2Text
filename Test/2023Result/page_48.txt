Calculation Formulas for (2) Performance-Linked Bonuses and (4) Performance-Linked Stock Remuneration
ITOCHU’s remuneration plan for Directors is designed to be an incentive to grow business performance. Variable remu-
neration ratio is extremely high, even when compared to other companies. The system clarifies management’s responsi-
bility, with Director remuneration increasing as performance improves, and significantly decreasing if performance 
deteriorates. Furthermore, this remuneration plan, including the calculation method, has been previously disclosed 
 publicly, making it highly transparent. More specifically, the remuneration plan consists of fixed remuneration (1) monthly 
remuneration, and variable remuneration (2) performance-linked bonuses, (3) share price-linked bonuses, and (4) perfor-
mance-linked stock remuneration, with performance-linked bonuses reflecting short-term performance and share price-
linked bonuses and performance-linked stock remuneration reflecting the enhancement of corporate value in the medium 
to long term.
  Monthly remuneration is decided based on the standard amount by position and the level of contribution to ITOCHU, 
including its response to climate change, the SDGs, and ESG.
  The Company has adopted consolidated net profit as the linked indicator for the performance-linked bonus and per-
formance-linked stock remuneration, as it is the source of capital for growth-oriented investment and returns to share-
holders, and is of high interest on the stock market. In the unlikely event that consolidated net profit falls into a deficit, 
there is a strict system whereby no such bonus or remuneration is paid out. Furthermore, the share-price linked bonuses, 
which are indices linked to ITOCHU’s share price, are calculated based on the increase in ITOCHU’s stock price for each 
consecutive two fiscal years and relative evaluation between the growth rate of the average value of ITOCHU’s share 
price and the growth rate of the average value of the Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX).

Total Amount Paid to All Directors  
Total amount paid to all Directors  
= (A + B + C) x Sum of position points for all the eligible Directors ÷ 55
A =  (Of consolidated net profit for FYE 2024, the portion up to 
¥200.0 billion) x 0.35%
B =  (Of consolidated net profit for FYE 2024, the portion 
 exceeding ¥200.0 billion and up to ¥300.0 billion) x 0.525%
C =  (Of consolidated net profit for FYE 2024, the portion 
 exceeding ¥300.0 billion) x 0.525% (of which, 0.175% as 
stock remuneration)
Amount Paid to an Individual Director  
Amount paid to an individual Director = Total amount paid to  
all Directors x Position points ÷ Sum of position points for  
all the  eligible Directors. Amount paid to an individual Director is 
determined by dividing total amount paid to all Directors based 
on points assigned by position shown below:

Of the amount paid to an individual Director, the portion corre-
sponding to A and B is paid entirely in cash. In regard to the por-
tion corresponding to C, 0.175% is paid as stock remuneration 
and the balance is paid in cash. Furthermore, 80%*1 of the 
amount paid in cash is linked to a rate determined based on  
the plan achievement rate of the consolidated net profit of the 
assigned division / department. In regard to stock remuneration 
during the term of office, annual points are awarded (1 point =  
1 share), and after retirement stock remuneration is paid from the 
trust in correspondence with accumulated points. Plans call for 
The total amount paid shall be the sum of A, B, and C, which 
shall be adjusted with due regard to the increase / decrease in 
the number of eligible Directors, the change in position, and other 
factors. (Remuneration limits exist on bonuses and stock 
remuneration.)
all of the stocks paid from the trust to be acquired on the stock 
market, and accordingly there will be no dilution of shares.
*1  Formula for 80% of the amount paid in cash to an individual Director: 
(Total base amount paid to all Directors x Position point / Sum of position 
points for all the eligible Directors) x 80% x (Rate determined based on plan 
achievement rate of the consolidated net profit of the assigned division / 
department*2)
*2  Rate determined based on plan achievement rate of the consolidated net 
profit of the assigned division / department: 
100% + (Plan achievement rate of the consolidated net profit of the assigned 
division / department – 100%) x 2 (if negative, it will be 0%. Maximum will be 
200%.)
*3  Among the Company’s Directors in FYE 2024, a Director has been assigned 
the Machinery Company as the division / department whose business perfor-
mance evaluation is reflected. The plan value for the consolidated net profit of 
the Machinery Company in FYE 2024 is ¥105.0 billion (announced on May 9, 
2023). However, the standard amount for business performance evaluation 
has been set at ¥110.0 billion to provide an incentive for further enhancement 
of business performance.
*4  The plan achievement rate shall be 100% for the eligible Director for whom no 
plan achievement rate is measurable.
Calculation Formula for (3) Share Price-Linked Bonuses
Amount paid to an individual Director*1 (FYE 2024)  
= ((Simple average of daily closing price of ITOCHU stock in FYE 2024) – (Simple average of daily closing price of ITOCHU stock from 
FYE 2022 to FYE 2023)) × 1,300,000 × (Position points*2 of FYE 2024) / (108.8 points)  
× Relative stock price growth rate*3 × 1/2
Amount Paid to an Individual Director*1 (FYE 2025)  
= ((Simple average of daily closing price of ITOCHU stock from FYE 2024 to FYE 2025) – (Simple average of daily closing price of 
ITOCHU stock from FYE 2022 to FYE 2023)) × 1,300,000 × (Total position points*2 of FYE 2024 and FYE 2025) / (108.8 points × 2)  
× Relative stock price growth rate*4 – Share Price-linked Bonuses of FYE 2024
*1  Share price-linked bonus amounts are determined and paid after the Director retires (after the Executive Officer retires, in the case of taking on the position of Executive Officer 
after retirement of the Director). If the amount calculated based on the calculation formula is negative, the amount paid to an individual Director for the relevant year will be zero.
*2 The position points assigned to each Director are the same as those applied for calculating (2) performance-linked bonuses.
*3  Relative stock price growth rate = (Simple average of daily closing price of ITOCHU stock in FYE 2024 / Simple average of daily closing price of ITOCHU stock from 
FYE 2022 to FYE 2023) / (Simple average of daily TOPIX in FYE 2024 / Simple average of daily TOPIX from FYE 2022 to FYE 2023)
*4  Relative stock price growth rate = (Simple average of daily closing price of ITOCHU stock from FYE 2024 to FYE 2025 / Simple average of daily closing price of 
ITOCHU stock from FYE 2022 to FYE 2023) / (Simple average of daily TOPIX from FYE 2024 to FYE 2025 / Simple average of TOPIX from FYE 2022 to FYE 2023)
