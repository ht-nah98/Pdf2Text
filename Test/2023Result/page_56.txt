Specific Example of Realizing Business Transformation by Shifting to a Market-Oriented Perspective  
Building a Rooibos Tea Value Chain
Rooibos tea is attracting attention due in part to its caffeine-free qualities. In response to growing consumer interest in health and 
beauty, we are importing rooibos tea ingredients, which we process, brand, and sell to beverage manufacturers and convenience stores. 
Rooibos is a rare plant cultivated only in the Republic of South Africa. Over the past 10 years, exports of this plant to Japan have grown 
rapidly, and increased approximately sevenfold. Together with ITOCHU Food Sales and Marketing Co., Ltd., ITOCHU functions as an 
organizer in building the entire value chain and holds an overwhelming share of approximately 50% of rooibos products sold to major 
Japanese beverage manufacturers.
  Based on a market-oriented perspective, we will continue developing high-value-added ingredients and rolling out products that cater 
to consumer demands.
