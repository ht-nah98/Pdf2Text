CFO Interview
  Under the initial plan for FYE 2024, we announced that 
when we revise the forecast upward during the fiscal 
year, we would execute additional shareholder returns 
eyeing a total payout ratio of 40%. In order to meet 
market expectations for the final year of the medium-term 
management plan, in which we are at the ¥800.0 billion 
stage, we will first focus on firmly achieving the second 
quarter numbers, assess the future progress and growth 
expectations, and consider an upward revision.
   What is your policy for growth investments 
in FYE 2024?
   We will continue to consider and promote 
growth investments that contribute to the 
 interests of all stakeholders.
The current medium-term management plan is the third 
plan announced since I became CFO. Under “Brand-new 
Deal 2017 (FYE 2016–2018),” core operating cash flows 
for the three-year period comprised inflows of ¥1,255.0 
billion and net investment cash outflows of ¥970.0 billion, 
due in part to our investment in CITIC. Core free cash 
flows after deducting ¥318.0 billion of shareholder returns 
were close to zero. Over the three years of this medium-
term management plan, the ratio of shareholder returns 
to investments was approximately one for shareholder 
returns and three for investments. Next, under “Brand-
new Deal 2020 and the FYE 2021 Management Plan 
(FYE 2019–2021),” core operating cash flows for the 
three years comprised inflows of ¥1,691.0 billion and net 
investment cash outflows of ¥1,065.0 billion, due in part 
to privatization of FamilyMart. Core free cash flows after 
deducting ¥529.0 billion of shareholder returns turned 
positive at approximately ¥100.0 billion. Over the three 
years, the ratio of shareholder returns to investments was 
approximately one for shareholder returns and two for 
investments. The ratio of shareholder returns was higher 
than the ratio during “Brand-new Deal 2017.” During the 
six years of these two medium-term management plans, 
although we invested in major projects that form our cur-
rent foundation for growth, including the investment in 
CITIC and privatization of FamilyMart, we have main-
tained positive core free cash flows after deducting 
shareholder returns. In addition, consolidated net profit 
have almost doubled over these six years, expanding 
from approximately ¥400.0 billion to approximately 
¥800.0 billion.
  Finally, due in part to the steady accumulation of oper-
ating cash flows, core operating cash flows were approxi-
mately ¥1,661.0 billion positive during the previous two 
years (FYE 2022–2023) under “Brand-new Deal 2023.” 
While net investment cash outflows were approximately 
¥346.0 billion, due in part to asset replacements and 
advanced divestments. Core free cash flows after 
deducting ¥488.0 billion of shareholder returns for the 
previous two years remained positive at ¥827.0 billion. 
Although we have not disclosed a forecast for core oper-
ating cash flows in FYE 2024, if the level remains similar 
to that of the past two years, because we have already 
committed to a dividend payout ratio of 30% and a total 
payout ratio of 33%, shareholder returns will be approxi-
mately ¥260.0 billion, and core free cash flows after 
deducting shareholder returns will be ¥500.0–¥600.0 bil-
lion. Similar to the two previous medium-term manage-
ment plans, if core free cash flows after deducting 
shareholder returns are to be zero or just above zero for 
the three years of the current medium-term management 
plan, we would add ¥500.0–¥600.0 billion of core free 
cash flows after deducting shareholder returns in FYE 
2024 to the ¥827.0 billion of core free cash flows after 
deducting shareholder returns generated in the previous 
two years. The total, excluding the capital expenditure 
which occurs regularly and additional shareholder 
returns, would be the investable amounts in FYE 2024.
In FYE 2024, including the tender offer bids (TOB) 
for CTC and DAIKEN CORPORATION, which were 
announced in August 2023, we have already built up a

highly probable investment pipeline in each sector, and 
are planning to increase cash allocation to growth invest-
ments. We, of course, do not believe we will be able to 
execute every investments in the pipeline, but will maxi-
mize growth investments with the goal of boosting our 
current profit stage to beyond the ¥800.0 billion level. 
We will also continue “preparations” to maintain high 
ROE through sustained profit expansion.
In my ninth year as CFO, I held interviews with inves-
tors and shareholders, including members of Berkshire 
Hathaway Inc., who visited Japan in April 2023. I also

represented ITOCHU in discussions with credit rating 
agencies. With a firm recognition of the significance of 
these actions, I will fulfill my duties as CFO. As I enter my 
sixth year as Chair of the Investment Consultative 
Committee, I promise to consider and promote growth 
investments that contribute to the interests of all stake-
holders, by fully exercising my capabilities, following com-
prehensive assessments of the current economic 
situation, the trend toward sustainability, as well as les-
sons learned from our past investments.
