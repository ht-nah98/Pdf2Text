Corporate Governance
■ Policy on the Governance of Listed Subsidiaries
ITOCHU respects the autonomy of listed subsidiaries and prohibits any acts that contradict the principle of shareholder 
equality, in accordance with ITOCHU’s Policy on the Governance of Its Listed Subsidiaries, which was announced in 
October 2019. Each subsidiary and ITOCHU are in a mutually beneficial relationship to enhance corporate value as busi-
ness partners. With the recognition that there is a potential conflict of interest between ITOCHU and the minority share-
holders of these listed subsidiaries, we ensure independent decision-making at listed subsidiaries by encouraging them 
to establish well-functioning governance structures that effectively utilize independent outside directors. Further, the 
Company does not conclude governance-related agreements with any listed subsidiary.
ITOCHU periodically reviews the significance of holding listed subsidiaries in light of their position in management strat-
egies and then purchases additional shares or disposes of shares as necessary. In FYE 2021, the Company privatized 
FamilyMart Co., Ltd., and in FYE 2023 the Company disposed of shares of CONEXIO Corporation. Going forward, the 
Company will continue to periodically review the significance of holding listed subsidiaries and further improve Group 
governance systems in light of the Corporate Governance Code. In addition, the Company has investments in multiple 
listed affiliates. The Company gives due consideration to avoiding conflicts of interest in transactions with such affiliates. 
Also, taking into consideration the actual situations of each affiliate, including capital relationships and the status of trans-
actions, the Company implements measures in accordance with those implemented for listed subsidiaries as necessary. 
  The significance of holding each listed subsidiary from perspectives including the Group’s management strategy is
