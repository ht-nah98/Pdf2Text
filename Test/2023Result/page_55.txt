Specific Example of Enhancing Our Contribution to and Engagement with the SDGs  
Expansion of Renewable Energy-Based Electricity Supply Business
Since beginning capital participation in Clean Energy Connect, Inc. (CEC), in November 2021, ITOCHU has been supporting the rapid 
promotion and expansion of the renewable energy-based electricity supply business. We have been helping CEC realize its plan to intro-
duce approximately 5,000 locations of solar power generating facilities in Japan with a cumulative total output of 500 MW by FYE 2026, 
without relying on feed-in tariffs (FIT). As part of these efforts, we have concluded power purchase agreements (PPA) through CEC to 
supply renewable energy to the Amazon Group, and other companies in Japan on a long-term basis. These agreements are helping the 
Amazon Group to reach its goal of operating its own business entirely on renewable energy by 2025. Through its initiatives with CEC, 
ITOCHU seeks to become one of the largest off-site Corporate PPA (Power Sales Contracts for Industries) operators in Japan. With 
these and other efforts, we will help promote the further introduction of renewable energy.
