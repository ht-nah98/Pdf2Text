Specific Example of Realizing Business Transformation by Shifting to a Market-Oriented Perspective  
Further Development and Expansion of the Digital Advertising Distribution Business
In October 2020, ITOCHU established Data One Corp. with FamilyMart Co., Ltd., NTT DOCOMO, INC., and CyberAgent, Inc. 
Leveraging the advantages of the purchasing data of FamilyMart together with approximately 29 million licensed advertisement IDs, one 
of the largest collection of such IDs in Japan, Data One Corp. is developing a unique advertising business that offers end-to-end ser-
vices from digital advertisement distribution to effectiveness verification.
  For example, beginning with the partnership with Pan Pacific International Holdings Corporation started in April 2023, we will increase 
data collaborations in the retail media field with retailers and other companies. At the same time, we will combine digital advertising with 
digital signage to be installed at 10,000 FamilyMart stores by 2023, with the aim of integrating physical and digital media and further 
evolving the advertising business.
  We will accelerate growth of the advertising business and improve the customer experience by delivering information that customers 
want in a timely manner.
