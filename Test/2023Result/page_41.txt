ITOCHU Corporation Annual Report 2023
Approach to Climate Change and Related Initiatives
ITOCHU discloses the GHG emissions of all fossil fuel businesses and interests associated with the Company, and it will 
fully withdraw from thermal coal interests during the period of the current medium-term management plan. By reducing 
GHG emissions and proactively advancing business that help reduce emissions, we are contributing to the realization of 
the Japanese Government’s “2050 Carbon Neutral” goal.
  Our Company also recognizes the importance of disclosing climate-related financial information and has worked to 
disclose information based on TCFD* recommendations since expressing support for them in May 2019.
* The Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, established by the Financial Stability Board (FSB)
■ Governance for Climate Change
At ITOCHU, the Sustainability Management Division plans and proposes measures and initiatives to address risks and 
opportunities related to climate change, and the Sustainability Committee deliberates and decides these measures and 
initiatives. The CAO, the Representative Director responsible for climate change-related issues, chairs the Sustainability 
Committee, and is responsible for presenting and reporting to the Board of Directors the matters duly deliberated and 
decided at the Sustainability Committee. This allows the Board of Directors to properly supervise the appropriate promo-
tion of business strategies that respond to environmental and social risks and opportunities based on the deliberations 
and decisions of the Sustainability Committee. The Board of Directors deliberates and decides important matters, such 
as management plans based on GHG emissions reduction goals and initiatives.
  Additionally, we periodically engage in dialogue with external stakeholders, such as the Sustainability Advisory Board, 
to understand society’s expectations and demands, etc., regarding our policies, initiatives, and systems related to climate 
change and incorporate them into measures addressing climate change.
■ Climate Change Strategy
ITOCHU sets GHG emissions reduction and offset targets (  Page 80), analyzes scenarios based on TCFD recommenda-
tions and continuously considers business strategies and asset replacement. As a result of conducting scenario analysis 
in accordance with TCFD recommendations, we can maintain a strong business foundation by transitioning to environ-
mentally friendly products and services that customers demand and also by reviewing our business portfolio. 
  Since FYE 2020, we have analyzed and disclosed transition risks such as policy and regulatory risks under scenarios of 
less than 2°C as well as physical risks such as natural disasters under a 4°C scenario for the “Power Generation 
Business,” “Energy Business,” “Coal Business,” “Dole Business,” and “Pulp Business.” 
  Additionally, for FYE 2023, we newly analyzed and disclosed the “Iron Ore Business,” “Automobile Business,” 
“Chemicals Business,” and “Feed and Grain Trade Business” under a 1.5°C scenario.
  The results of scenario analysis of the “Iron Ore Business,” which faces transition risks as the main challenge, and  
the “Feed and Grain Trade Business,” which faces physical risks as the main challenge, are shown on the following page. 
Please refer to ITOCHU’s website for detailed information about its scenario analysis  
for the “Iron Ore Business” and the “Feed and Grain Trade Business.”

Scenario Analysis
Businesses for Which Transition Risks Are the Main Issues
Businesses for Which Physical Risks Are the Main Issues
Business
Time frame
Iron ore business
By 2050
Temperature band scenario
1.5°C scenario
Opportunities
•  The stable supply of low-carbon emission steelmaking 
raw materials
Transition
•  Creation of a new low-carbon emission steelmaking raw 
materials business
Risk
•  Increase in cost of fuels and materials due to the intro-
duction of a carbon tax
Feed and grain trade business
By 2030
4°C scenario
Opportunity
•  We may capture demand with feed products and other 
low-carbon-related products which contribute to reduc-
ing GHG
Main risks and 
opportunities
Risks
•  Increase in procurement costs due to the increased 
 frequency of severe weather events and worsening 
water scarcity
Opportunity
•  We may maintain a supply structure by diversifying the 
countries from where we import crops and capture 
demand for grain
•  Disruption of iron ore supply chain due to frequent 
Physical
weather disasters
The introduction of a carbon tax is expected to increase 
the cost of fuel, materials, and other items. Nevertheless, 
the impact on earnings will be limited due to strengthened 
relationships with blue-chip business partners and 
improvement of operational efficiencies. Further growth is 
expected by focusing on the production of high-grade ore, 
for which demand is expected to increase due to the 
acceleration of the shift to decarbonization, and steadily 
seizing business opportunities in iron ore and related 
fields, such as creation of businesses related to low- 
carbon emission steelmaking raw materials.
Risks
•  Decrease in the amount of crops harvested and logistics 
disruption due to large hurricanes, droughts and other 
abnormal weather in countries from where we import 
crops
•  The amount of crops harvested may decrease and 
transaction prices may increase in countries from where 
we import crops due to rising temperatures
The decrease in the amount of crops harvested due to 
weather disasters and rising temperatures may lead to 
supply instability and increases in prices. However, we can 
maintain a supply structure by diversifying the countries 
from where we import crops and then provide further 
opportunities for low-carbon-related products.

Business opportunities
•  We will closely monitor trends in low-carbon emission 
steelmaking technologies and promote initiatives to 
ensure a stable supply of low-carbon emission steel-
making raw materials
•  Promote initiatives to reduce GHG emissions by 
strengthening relationships with business partners
•  We will diversify the countries from where we import 
crops to prepare for the acute and chronic impacts from 
climate change
•  We will engage in new environment-related business 
such as feed which leads to a curb on methane 
emissions
■ Climate Change Risk Management
Engaged in global business operations, ITOCHU constantly monitors climate change policies in each country, abnormal 
weather conditions around the world, or changes in average temperatures. Climate change risks identified from informa-
tion regarding climate change related regulations and abnormal weather, etc., are managed as one of the major risks, 
“environmental and social risks,” in risk analyses conducted across the entire Group. Additionally, the identified climate 
change risks are evaluated and examined during the investment decision-making process, and each department in 
charge of risk management is responsible for constructing a consolidated basis to identify, evaluate, manage, and moni-
tor risks.
