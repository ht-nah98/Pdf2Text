Specific Example of Realizing Business Transformation by Shifting to a Market-Oriented Perspective  
Conversion of Major Provider of a Foreign Exchange Margin Transactions (FX) Platform,  
Gaitame.Com Co., Ltd. into an Affiliate
In September 2022, the major provider of an FX margin transaction platform, Gaitame.Com Co., Ltd. (Gaitame.Com), became an affiliate 
of ITOCHU. The FX market continues to grow steadily, posting record-high trading volumes in 2022. With its customer-first philosophy, 
Gaitame.Com’s strengths lie in its ability to provide thoroughly customer-centric services that offer one of the lowest fee levels in the 
industry, savings-type services that allow customers to build their assets over the long term, and high-quality FX-related information. 
Based on these strengths, Gaitame.com has grown its number of accounts to approximately 590 thousands as of March 2023, and is 
continuing to expand its number of users. 
ITOCHU will support the further expansion of Gaitame.Com’s customer base through collaboration with ITOCHU’s retail finance busi-
ness in relation to loans and payments. At the same time, we are developing services in the field of asset management that cater to 
consumer needs.
Delivering high-quality FX-related information
