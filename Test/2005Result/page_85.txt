Capital resources
As part of ITOCHU’s medium-term management plan until the
end of March 2007 (Frontier-2006), Company’s basic policy is
pursuing the selection, focusing, and reallocating and upgrading
of assets to expand the scale of profits and create new business.
With respect to promoting this plan, the source for new
expenditures for investment activities is financing from operating
cash flow. This includes the sale and recovery of assets in the
course of redeployment, as well as from the accumulation of
profits. Any shortfall in financial resources when new investments
are made a priority, is to be covered through borrowed money
and the issuance of bonds. However, any increase in the total of
interest-bearing debts will be held in check through the imple-
mentation of strict controls.
Cash and cash equivalents for this fiscal year were reduced by
21.8% or ¥126.6 billion from fiscal 2004 to ¥452.9 billion ($4,218
million). This reflects efforts to reduce interest-bearing debts
through a liquidation of cash and cash equivalents to improve
the Company’s financial position. Cash flow requirements for in
investment activities, such as the acquisition of tangible fixed
assets, and new and additional investments, primarily in machin-
ery and money-related, were essentially covered by cash from
operating activities through an accumulation of profit.
Net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2005
increased ¥126.6 billion ($1,179 million). While there was a
reduction due to increases in trade receivables and inventory
caused by the active expansion of trading transactions and
rising prices of marketable commodities such as crude oil,
there were also large-scale increases in profit accumulation
based on solid business performance. This includes increases
in gross trading profits by all operating segments including the
Energy, Metals & Minerals as well as the Chemicals, Forest
products & General Merchandise.
Net cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2005 involved
expenditure of ¥127.6 billion ($1,188 million). This was mainly
due to new and additional investment in Orico in the financial
sector and Isuzu in the machinery sector, as well as the acquisi-
tion of tangible fixed assets. Though this figure exceeds last
year’s level of ¥55.3 billion resulting from the acquisition of
trademarks and mining rights, and from new and additional
investments, net cash provided by operating activities essen-
tially covered these increases.
Net cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2005
amounted to ¥125.3 billion ($1,167 million). This reflects con-
tinued efforts to reduce interest-bearing liabilities to improve
the Company’s financial position, and topped ¥79.7 billion
from the previous fiscal year.

The Company believes that funding generated by net cash pro-
vided by operating activities, borrowing from financial institu-
tions or the issuance of stocks or bonds in the capital market
will be sufficient to ensure an adequate source of funds to
cover expenditures and payments of liabilities, which it antici-
pates at this point, now and in the future. However, the actual
availability of funding may differ depending on future condi-
tions, such as the condition of financial markets, economy and
business operations and other factors, which the Company is
now unable to estimate accurately, because the Company
cannot control many of these. Nevertheless, the Company is
convinced that it will be capable of ensuring adequate liquidity
from cash flows provided by other sources, even if net cash
provided by operating activities falls short of current expecta-
tions.
