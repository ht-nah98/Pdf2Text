Certain agreements with the Japan Bank for International
Cooperation (“JBIC”) require as follows; 
1) The Company applies all or a portion of its operating
income or the proceeds from the sale of any debentures or
common stock to the reduction of outstanding loans when
JBIC believes that the Company is able to reduce such
loans through increased earnings
2) JBIC may request that any proposed distribution of earn-
ings be submitted to the JBIC for review before presenta-
tion to the stockholders. 
The Company has never received such a request and does
not expect that any such request will be made.
The Company and certain subsidiaries have entered into inter-
est rate swap agreements for certain long-term debts as a
means of managing their interest rate exposure.
Reference is made to note 7 for a description of collateral and
certain customary provisions of long-term and short-term
bank loan agreements relating to collateral and other rights of
such lenders.
The aggregate annual maturities of long-term debt after March

10. Retirement and Severance Benefits
The Company and certain subsidiaries have defined benefit
pension plans (e.g. the Corporate Pension Fund (“CPF”) and
the Tax-Qualified Pension Plan) covering substantially all of
their employees. Benefits under these pension plans are
based on years of service and certain other factors, and plan
assets are comprised primarily of marketable securities, debt
securities and other interest-bearing securities. In addition, the
Company and certain subsidiaries have both unfunded retire-
ment and severance plans, which provide lump-sum payment
benefits to their employees and defined contribution plans.
The Company and certain subsidiaries follow EITF 03-2,
“Accounting for the Transfer to the Japanese Government of
the Substitutional Portion of Employee Pension Fund
Liabilities.” During the year ended March 31, 2004, the
Company and certain subsidiaries transferred the substitu-
tional portion of the Employees’ Pension Fund (“EPF”) to the
government. The difference between the fair value of the oblig-
ation and the related assets of the substitutional portion was
¥19,606 million.
During the year ended March 31, 2004, the Company with-
drew a portion of the plan assets in excess of the projected
benefit obligation since the plan assets exceeded the pro-
The Company has borrowing arrangements with many finan-
cial institutions and has entered into commitment line agree-
ments with certain banks for working capital needs and stable
funding. The amounts available under such agreements were
¥510,000 million ($4,749 million) consisting of ¥300,000 mil-
lion ($2,794 million) for short-term debt and ¥210,000 million
($1,955 million) for long-term debt at March 31, 2005. The
Company intends that the long-term commitment line agree-
ments be used solely in support of refinancing the current
maturities of long-term debt. Because the agreements
demonstrate the Company’s ability to refinance and the
Company has expressed an intention to do so, the Company
has classified ¥210,000 million ($1,955 million) of the out-
standing balance of ¥465,173 million ($4,331 million) of cur-
rent maturities of long-term debt as non-current at March 31,
2005. ¥300,000 million ($2,794 million) of short-term commit-
ment agreements were unused at March 31, 2005. The
Company also has a loan agreement with a commitment line
of ¥17,000 million ($158 million) which was unused at March
31, 2005.
jected benefit obligation, due to the return of the substitutional
portion of EPF, a revision of the pension plans, and an
increase in the fair value of the plan assets attributable to a
rise in stock. During the year ended March 31, 2005, the com-
pany again withdrew a portion of the excess plan assets
because the fair value of the plan assets constantly exceeded
the projected benefit obligation. The fair value of the mar-
ketable securities and cash that the Company withdrew was
¥10,484 million ($98 million) and ¥3,600 million ($34 million),
respectively, for the year ended March 31, 2005, and ¥25,618
million and ¥5,080 million, respectively, for the year ended
March 31, 2004. 
The Company follows SFAS 132 (revised 2003), “Employers
Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement
Benefits,” which issued by the FASB, in December 2003, that
revises and prescribes employers disclosures about pension
plans and other postretirement benefit plans, while it does not
change the measurement or recognition provisions for those
plans from SFAS 87, “Employers’ Accounting for Pensions.”
The Company and certain subsidiaries use a measurement
date of March 31 for the majority of their plans.
