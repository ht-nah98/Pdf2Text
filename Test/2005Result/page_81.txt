Outlook for Fiscal 2006
Primary Issues to Address in fiscal 2006
Starting with fiscal 2006, the ITOCHU launched a new mid-
term management plan, “Frontier 2006: A shift to aggressive
business and solid management” (Two-year plan from fiscal
2006 through fiscal 2007). 
Forecast for Fiscal 2006
Domestically, ITOCHU forecasts a gradual brightening of the
outlook for individual consumers in fiscal 2006 due to an eas-
ing in wage cuts and a gradual recovery in employment as
capital expenditure expands, also supported by strong corpo-
rate profits and a recovery in exports, primarily for IT equip-
ment. The pace of recovery is expected to increase gradually.
Overseas, ITOCHU must continue to pay careful attention to
even greater imbalances in the U.S. economy, concerns over
overheated capital investment in China, and further hikes in
prices for primary commodities, particularly for crude oil.
Under these circumstances, the Company is expecting con-
solidated forecasts as presented in the table below for the fis-
cal 2006. 
These forecasts are forward looking statements that are
based on management’s assumptions and beliefs, based on
information currently available at the end of fiscal 2005, and
involve risks and uncertainties. Thus, factors that could cause
actual results to differ materially from such statements include,
without limitation, global economic and market conditions and
changes in foreign currency exchange rate.

Dividend policy and distribution of the current fiscal year’s profit
ITOCHU’s basic policy regarding dividend payments is a consistent and stable distribution of returns to the stockholders, while
increasing stockholders’ equity, and maintaining and strengthening its competitive power by retaining earnings.
For the fiscal year ending March 2006, ITOCHU intends to make an eight-yen (four yen for each of the interim and the year-end)
dividend payment per share.
