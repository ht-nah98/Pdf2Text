(1) Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
The Company and certain subsidiaries operate internationally
and are exposed to market risks arising from changes in for-
eign exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. The
Company and its subsidiaries utilize certain derivative instru-
ments principally in order to reduce these market risks.
The Company and certain subsidiaries have various deriva-
tive instruments, which are exposed to credit losses in the
event of non-performance by counterparties. The Company
and its subsidiaries seek to minimize credit risk by entering
into contracts only with major counterparties as well as avoid-
ing concentration with certain counterparties or groups of
counterparties. The policies of the Company and its sub-
sidiaries prescribe monitoring of creditworthiness and expo-
sure on a counterparty-by-counterparty basis.
Foreign Exchange Rate Risk Management
The Company and certain subsidiaries have assets and liabilities
which are exposed to foreign exchange rate risks. In order to
hedge the risks, mainly between the U.S. dollar and Japanese
yen, the Company and its subsidiaries enter into foreign
exchange contracts (including currency swap agreements).
These contracts are primarily used to fix future net cash
flows from recognized receivables and payables and unrecog-
nized firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies.
The Company and its subsidiaries establish the amounts of
net future cash flows for each currency by due dates and
enter into foreign exchange contracts (including currency
swap agreements) for certain portion of net future cash flows.
Most hedging relationships between the derivative financial
instruments and hedged items are highly effective in offsetting
impacts resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates.
Interest Rate Risk Management
The Company and certain subsidiaries are exposed to risks
of variability in future cash outflow or fluctuations in fair value
mainly on debt obligations. In order to manage these risks,
the Company and its subsidiaries enter into interest rate
swap agreements.
Interest rate swaps are used primarily to convert floating
rate debt to fixed rate debt and to convert fixed rate debt to
floating rate debt.
Most hedging relationships between the derivative financial
instruments and hedged items are highly effective in offsetting
changes in cash flows or fair values resulting from changes in
interest rates.
Commodity Price Risk Management
The Company and certain subsidiaries utilize commodity
derivative instruments for commodities, such as crude oil and
grain, principally to hedge fluctuations in cash flows or fair val-
ues due to changes in commodity prices.
Most hedging relationships between the commodity deriva-
tive instruments and hedged items are highly effective in off-
setting changes in cash flows or fair values resulting from
changes in commodity prices.
Risk Management Policy
The Company and its subsidiaries manage foreign exchange
rate risks, interest rate risks and commodity price risks by
continuously monitoring the movements and by seeking hedg-
ing opportunities to reduce such risks.
The Company and its subsidiaries set the limits for derivative
instruments based on the purpose of holding these instruments.
The risk management policies of the Company and its sub-
sidiaries state that derivative instruments for the most part are
held for hedging purposes.
The risk management policies including objectives and
strategies for undertaking derivative instruments are docu-
mented, and the Company and its subsidiaries make a formal
assessment at the hedgeâ€™s inception and quarterly on an on-
