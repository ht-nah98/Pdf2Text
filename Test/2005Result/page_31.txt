Gross trading profit for the fiscal year increased by ¥2.9
Financial Highlights
billion  to  ¥108.4  billion  despite  decreased  earnings  by
some  group  companies,  fueled  by  positive  financial
results by JAPAN AEROSPACE and favorable conditions
for  the  mobile  phone  business.  Net  income  recorded  a
sizeable increase from the previous fiscal year’s ¥2.6 bil-
lion,  rising  to  ¥14.4  billion.  Contributing  factors  were  the
stock listing of Excite Japan and a reduction in losses due
to business reorganization during the previous fiscal year.

Excite Japan Listing on JASDAQ
The  web  portal  Excite  Japan  gained  a  listing  on  JASDAQ  in
November 2004.
Since  ITOCHU  became  the  largest  shareholder  of  Excite
Japan  in  February  2002,  the  portal  undertook  developments
such as creating sites for women, establishing an Internet café
under  the  “Excite”  brand,  and  expanding  content  services
such as online gaming and music downloads. We are currently
well  on  our  way  to  achieving  differentiation  as  an  Internet
medium for young urban consumers in their 20s and 30s.
ITOCHU has positioned Excite Japan as a key platform for
the  e-business  field.  We  will  continue  to  improve  Excite
Japan’s content and services in support of its users.
