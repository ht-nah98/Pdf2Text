Powerful) strategy, whereby the Company channeled its efforts toward 
establishing a solid business foundation, to Frontier-2006, which focuses on 
earnings expansion. Under this new strategy, we will develop business in 
segments where we boast core competencies, with a view to achieving stable 
and sustained profit growth.
