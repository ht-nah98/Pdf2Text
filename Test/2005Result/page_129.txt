Independent Auditors’ Report
To the Board of Directors of
ITOCHU Corporation :
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of ITOCHU Corporation and subsidiaries as
of March 31, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity,
and cash flows for the years then ended (all expressed in Japanese yen). These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits. The consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended
March 31, 2003 were audited by other auditors whose report, dated May 23, 2003, expressed an unqualified
opinion on those statements.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes consideration of internal
control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circum-
stances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining,
on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, such 2005 and 2004 consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of ITOCHU Corporation and subsidiaries as of March 31, 2005 and 2004, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting princi-
ples generally accepted in the United States of America.
Our audits also comprehended the translation of Japanese yen amounts into U.S. dollar amounts and, in our
opinion, such translation has been made in conformity with the basis stated in Note 2. Such U.S. dollar
amounts are presented solely for the convenience of readers outside Japan.
