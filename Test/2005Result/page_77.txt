Adjusted profit:
Adjusted profit (net of gross trading profit, selling, general and
administrative expenses, net interest expenses, dividends
received and equity in earnings of associated companies
(including ¥2.2 billion, consisting of ¥1.8 billion of extraordinary
gain and ¥0.4 billion of minority interest, in profit from the nega-
tive goodwill arising from an acquisition of an equity-method
associated company in fiscal 2004)), indicates the basic earn-
ing power of ITOCHU. As such, adjusted profit for fiscal 2005
was ¥188.8 billion ($1,758 million), an improvement of ¥88.1
billion (87.5%) from the previous fiscal year. Excluding disposal
and devaluation losses for real estate inventories of ¥20.2 bil-
lion from previous fiscal year, this represents an increase of
¥68.0 billion. As can be seen, this indicates a significant
improvement in and a strengthening of the Company’s basic
earning power.
