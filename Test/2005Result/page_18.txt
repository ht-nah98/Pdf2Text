3. Cross-Company Focus Area 2: 
Natural Resource Development Sector
For the period of Frontier-2006, we instituted an earnings
plan for the natural resource development business that
takes into account the mildly conservative assumption of
the natural resource market. At the same time, we will
carefully select new investments in light of the increasing
price of acquiring stakes in natural resources. Also, we
will expand earnings while maintaining a high earnings
structure by increasing primarily investments in existing
businesses and increasing our acquisitions of stakes in
natural resources. We also expect to increase earnings
from existing projects by commencing and expanding
production in which we already hold stakes. Specific
examples include increased production in a large-scale oil
field development project in Azerbaijan and the com-
mencement of production at a new coal mining operation
in Australia. 
Efforts will also be concentrated in segments other than
energy, metal, and mineral resources, such as those
associated with the natural resource development busi-
ness. For example, we seek to expand upstream interests
in the paper pulp segment and thereby secure a stable
earnings source. 
4. Cross-Company Focus Area 3: 
Markets in North America and Asia Including China
ITOCHU will work to expand overseas earnings by contin-
uing to position two regions as priority markets. One is
Asia, especially China, where strong growth can be
expected for the foreseeable future, and the other is
North America, where we will take advantage of our exist-
ing business foundation and the large market. 
Asia, especially China, is a region where ITOCHU is well
positioned. To utilize this potential, we will conduct strate-
gic investments in the Consumer-Related sector, particu-
larly foods, and in infrastructure and natural resource
businesses. We will also seek to increase regional and
third-country transactions. 
In North America, we will use our strong profit base,
especially in the fields of housing materials, the brand
business, and automobiles, to underpin an expansion of
earnings. At the same time, efforts will be devoted to
acquiring new earnings sources through new invest-
ments.  
Plans also call for the laying of a cornerstone for devel-
opment in emerging markets where significant growth is
anticipated, such as Russia, India, and Brazil.
