The Company and its subsidiaries recognized impairment
losses on long-lived assets of ¥4,735 million ($44 million),
¥125,343 million and ¥2,150 million for the years ended
March 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, which were
included in “Loss on property and equipment-net” in the con-
solidated statements of operations. The impaired assets were
primarily domestic commercial rental buildings in the Finance,
Realty, Insurance & Logistics Services operating segment for
the year ended March 31, 2005 and domestic commercial
rental buildings and golf courses in the Finance, Realty,
Insurance & Logistics Services operating segment and
domestic property held for lease and unutilized assets in the
Other, Adjustments & Eliminations operating segment for the
year ended March 31, 2004. The impairments were generally
due to the slow recovery of rents for commercial buildings and
to the continuous decline in the market value of land in Japan. 
The fair values of long-lived assets were primarily determined
based on discounted cash flows and independent appraisals by
third parties.
Impairment losses recognized for the years ended March 31, 2005, and 2004 by operating segment were as follows:
