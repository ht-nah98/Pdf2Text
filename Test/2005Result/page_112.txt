Target Allocation
In setting its portfolio investment policy for plan assets, the
Company, on a long-term basis, focuses on securing invest-
ment returns that are sufficient to provide for the future benefit
payments for employees in the context of a tolerable level of
risk control. In order to achieve the objectives of the invest-
ment policy, the Company attempts to maintain an asset allo-
cation that is consistent with the investment policy for the
future periods while considering the standard deviation and
correlation coefficient of  invested assets as well as the esti-
mated returns on invested assets. The Company also
attempts to appropriately establish a target allocation, which
would be revised as needed, on a mid- and long-term basis
by considering the funded status of its pension plans. The
Company, based on its target allocation, evaluates the
trustees’ investment methods for each major category of plan
assets, to select the most suitable trustees and directs its
investment guideline to the trustees. In selecting the trustees,
the Company considers the investment philosophy and policy
of the trustees, their investment methodology, their internal
control and compliance policy for investing, their experience
and past investment performance. Generally, the Company
evaluates the trustees every three years from both a qualitative
and quantitative perspective and changes the trustees as
needed. The Company is currently evaluating its target alloca-
In addition, the Company determines its expected long-term
rate of return considering the above investment policy, the
expectations of future returns and historical returns on plan
assets.
