DEAR STOCKHOLDERS AND CUSTOMERS
ITOCHU Corporation achieved a historical high net income of 
¥77.8 billion for the fiscal year ended March 2005. 
Now that ITOCHU has gained financial strength and established a highly
efficient profit structure through our past management restructurings 
and A&P strategy,* it is time for us to shift in earnest 
from a defensive to an offensive business approach 
under our new mid-term management plan, “Frontier-2006.”
We will channel our efforts into areas of unique competence that ITOCHU
alone can provide. As a Group, we aim to utilize fully our comprehensive 
lateral strengths across the Division Companies to generate a net income of 
more than ¥100 billion steadily and sustainedly.
