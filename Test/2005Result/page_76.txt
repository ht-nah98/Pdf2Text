the communications and financial related sectors and the sale
of shares of a certain bank, ITOCHU recognized a ¥46.9 billion
of other-than-temporary impairment on marketable securities
which included a ¥45.1 billion impairment loss on equity
method goodwill of ITOCHU’s investment in FamilyMart. In
addition to this, ITOCHU also recognized a ¥7.1 billion loss on
the restructuring of businesses. As a result, total losses on the
disposal of investments and marketable securities increased
to ¥25.4 billion for fiscal 2005 from ¥13.6 billion fiscal 2004.
Loss on property and equipment-net amounted to ¥6.0
billion, an improvement of ¥123.5 billion from the previous fis-
cal year. This marked a tremendous improvement from the
previous period, when ITOCHU suffered a ¥121.8 billion
impairment loss for fixed assets, as well as a ¥2.3 billion
impairment loss in overseas aircraft leases.
Due to an improvement in losses on foreign exchange and
the booking of reserves for losses on guarantees for debt,
ITOCHU recognized a ¥0.4 billion profit for other-net in fiscal
2005. This was an improvement of ¥14.4 billion from the pre-
vious fiscal year.

Equity in earnings of associated companies for the current fis-
cal year increased to ¥31.8 billion ($296 million), an ¥8.9 billion
(39.0%) improvement from the previous period. This was due
to the commencement of natural gas production and a strong
demand for Energy, Metals & Minerals from the steel products
industry, in addition to solid demand experienced by equity-
method associated companies for Aerospace, Electronics &
Multimedia, Food and Finance, Realty, Insurance & Logistics
Service. The results of major equity-method associated com-
panies were shown under “Major Group Companies Reporting
Profits” and “Major Group Companies Reporting Losses”
under the title of “Performance of Subsidiaries and Equity-
Method Associated Companies.”
