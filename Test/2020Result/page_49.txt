Risk Management
Risk Capital Management* and Management of Concentration Risk
Strict Management of Risk Assets
Our basic operational policy involves first calculating risk 
assets based on the maximum amount of possible future 
losses from all assets on the balance sheet including in-
vestments and all off-balance-sheet transactions. Second, 
we manage the amount of risk assets within the limits of 
our risk buffer (Total shareholders’ equity + Non-controlling 
interests). As we promote investments that will lead to 
evolve existing business moving forward, we will work 
to maintain risk assets within the limits of our risk buffer, 
conduct strict risk management, and further strengthen 
our financial position.

Significant Risks to Be Managed on a Consolidated Basis
The ITOCHU Group is exposed to various risks due to its 
wide range of business natures, such as multiple risks in 
markets, credit risks, and investment risks. These risks 
include unpredictable uncertainties and may have signifi-
cant effects on the Group’s future financial position and 
business performance.
  We acknowledge risk management as a key manage-
ment issue. Therefore, we have established our basic risk 
management policy and develop necessary risk manage-
ment systems and methods. Specifically, we have defined 
the following 18 risks as major risks and are responding to 
Individual Risk Categories (Major Risks)
them by building information management and monitoring 
systems at each department responsible for managing 
these risks on a consolidated basis. In addition, we periodi-
cally review the effectiveness of management systems 
through our internal committees. 
  With COVID-19 having a wide-ranging impact, we have 
used asterisks (*) to indicate those of the 18 risks indicated 
below that we believe have a relatively high likelihood of 
materializing.
