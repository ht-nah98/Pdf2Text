Harufumi Mochizuki
Outside Director
Mr. Mochizuki was appointed as an Audit & 
Supervisory Board Member of ITOCHU 
in June 2014 and a Director in June 2017, 
following a position as the Vice Minister of 
Economy, Trade and Industry. In FYE 2020, 
he served as the Chairman of the Nomination 
Committee, and lead deliberations on the 
appointment and dismissal of key manage-
ment members and succession plans. He 
provides many beneficial and broad-minded 
suggestions on topics including internal 
control, compliance, and next-generation 
businesses.
Ensuring and Improving Transparency of 
Decision-Making
There are always many number of options and directions 
to consider when making business decisions. I believe the 
primary role of Outside Directors in corporate governance 
is to maintain an objective and comprehensive perspective 
and examine whether all the necessary factors have been 
considered, such as various possibilities and accompanying 
risks, and voice opinions to the management team. I am 
confident that steps to ensure and improve the transpar-
ency and fairness of decision-making at ITOCHU have 
led to even better management, as Outside Directors give 
management their frank opinions based on their specialized 
knowledge and diverse backgrounds, while management 
carefully listen to these opinions.
  Succession plans for management are one of the most 
important issues for maintaining and improving the effec-
tiveness of corporate governance at ITOCHU. During my 
tenure as the Chairman of the Nomination Committee for 
two years since FYE 2019, we periodically discussed suc-
cession plans, and had lively conversations about the 
“ideal” manager as he or she is pressured to make bold 
decisions, and policies for grooming successors. In FYE 
2020, we worked on having more practical discussions 
by taking a more flexible approach to meetings, such as 
creating opportunities for only Outside Directors on the 
committee to have discussions.
