Driving Force for Sustainable Value Creation
Creating Synergies Infinitely —Vertically and Horizontally
The ITOCHU Group is building and enhancing a value chain spanning upstream to downstream operations with 
the aim of maximizing earnings from the Convenience Store business. In addition to fortifying the food value 
chain, we are generating synergies among businesses by making The 8th Company the starting point and going 
beyond Division Companies’ boundaries in such areas as daily necessities, financial services, system develop-
ment, and construction materials.
