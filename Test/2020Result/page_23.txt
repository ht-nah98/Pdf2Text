1990s
Set the Steppingstones  
for the Current Business 
We introduced management reform 
measures to sweep away negative legacy 
assets from the bubble era. At the same 
time, we set in place the steppingstones 
for the future by acquiring shares in 
FamilyMart in 1998. In 1999, ITOCHU 
TECHNO-SCIENCE Corporation (currently, 
ITOCHU Techno-Solutions Corporation) 
was listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.

Shift to Aggressive Stance and 
Strengthen Our Financial 
Foundation
We took decisive action to dispose of 
 low-efficiency and unprofitable assets. 
Simultaneously, to adopt more sophisticated 
risk management, we introduced a quantita-
tive risk management method. As our finan-
cial position improved, earnings from the 
resource business expanded as we entered 
the commodities super cycle period. 
Ahead of other general trading companies, 
we pioneered a shift into the non-resource 
sector. We commenced a strategic busi-
ness alliance and capital participation with 
CITIC and CP Group and acquired Dole 
business and METSA FIBRE OY. We also 
strengthened our financial position further 
and promoted cash flow management.
FYE 2021
Preparing for Global Recession 
Given the uncertain duration and extent 
of economic recession, we will strive to 
maximize our management capabilities 
in an environment affected by COVID-19 
and erect the foundations for the post- 
COVID-19 world. We will thoroughly instill 
the “earn, cut, prevent” principles.
