Achievement of Short-Term Targets
The Trajectory for Enhancing Corporate Value  
under the “Brand-new Deal” Strategy (Management Plan)
Brand-new Deal 2012 (FYE 2012–2013)
“Earn, Cut, Prevent” 
Brand-new Deal 2014 (FYE 2014–2015)
“Aiming to be the No. 1 Trading Company in the 
Non-Resource Sector”
Shape and implement initiatives surrounding the business fundamen-
tals of “earn, cut, prevent.” Aim to expand earnings through active 
 investments, while strengthening management foundation through 
corporate governance system, etc.
Redouble our focus on the non-resource sector, the area of our 
strength, rather than relying on earnings from the highly volatile 
resource sector. As one of the top three general trading companies, 
further entrench our position as No. 1 in the non-resource sector.

and therefore achieved solid recognition.
