Consolidated Net Profit (Non-Resource / Resource) (Billions of Yen)
Increased earnings in the non-
resource sector, despite decline 
in commodity prices, and  
impairment loss on a U.S. oil 
and gas development-related 
company
Impairment losses in the 
resource sector were offset  
by increased earnings in  
the non-resource sector
Impairment losses primar-
ily in the non-resource 
sector, with a view to 
reducing future risks
Growth in the Food, the ICT & Financial 
Business, and other non-resource 
fields; CITIC’s contribution to profits; 
rebound from extraordinary gains and 
losses recognized in FYE 2016
Profit increase in the non- 
resource sector, and higher 
prices for resources thereby 
moving toward the ¥500.0 
billion level
A robust earnings base stemming 
from a diversified business portfolio 
provides the wherewithal to solidify 
earnings base at ¥500.0 billion in 
consolidated net profit
