“Prevent”—Upgrading Business Investment Management
We are enhancing asset replacement and improving issues of subsidiaries and affiliates by monitoring returns against expec-
tations at the time of investment. Moreover, even profitable investments should potentially be exited if returns are lower than 
the cost of capital.
Exit Criteria for Business Investment
(1) Cumulative losses over three years
(2) Returns lower than expected at time of investment
(3)  Cumulative losses in added value over three years [Consolidated contribution* – (Consolidated investment carrying amount x Cost of capital)]
* Consolidated contribution is the total of net profit and trade merit.
Positive added value
Negative added value
Consolidated contribution positive but lower than 
cost of capital = Low-efficiency investment,  
therefore consider exiting even if profitable

is met:

Each investing division of the target company discusses on whether to continue or exit from the business.

Matters to be overcome:
(1) Improve consolidated returns
(2)  Curtail increases in the consoli-
dated investment carrying amount
(3)  Prevent negative returns and 
losses
Apply to the HMC and deliberate whether or not to continue the business
