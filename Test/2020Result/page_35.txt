Creating a Value Chain in the Convenience Store Business
Centering on FamilyMart, we are creating and enhancing a value chain spanning 
upstream to downstream operations. At the same time, we are working to maximize 
Group synergies through the provision of business infrastructure involving such areas 
as non-food products, financial and insurance services, electricity supply, and system 
configuration. We are also collaborating with FamilyMart to utilize its data to develop 
new businesses and moving ahead with reinventing the value chain.

How ITOCHU Differs from a General Private Equity Fund
As we consider business investment one of our major options, our 
business model is often compared to that of a private equity fund. 
There are certain similar aspects, such as the desire to contribute 
proactively to management and maximize the corporate value of 
investees. We view as different, however, the facts that we are 
also aiming to increase our own corporate value as we focus on 
generating synergy with existing businesses and enjoy returns 
(cash) centered on trading profits and dividends.
