Overcoming 
Numerous 
Turbulent Seas  
as a Merchant
Over a history of more than 160 years since its 
founding, ITOCHU has faced various social  
upheavals and serious economic downturns.  
There was even the “period of hardship” when our 
raison d’être was questioned due to changes in the 
social structure.
  On countless occasions, we overcame turbulent 
seas as we continued to hone ourselves. Our driving 
force has been our ability as a merchant to sniff out 
change and respond with flexibility and swiftness to 
changes in the business structure: “proactive, agile, 
and rational” management.
