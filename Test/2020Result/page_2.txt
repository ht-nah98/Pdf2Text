“Sampo-yoshi,” Our Values for Creating the Future
Founded in 
1858
“Trade is a compassionate business.  
It is noble when it accords with
the spirit of Buddha by profiting those  
who sell and those who buy
and supplying the needs of the society.”

Now part of Shiga Prefecture, the area near Lake Biwa was formerly known as the province of Ohmi.  
In 1858, a peddler boy aged just 15 set out in search of trade from this area, far away from commercial centers.  
This boy was Chubei Itoh I, ITOCHU’s founder. He was a man of strong convictions and  
high ideals about his business, which he expressed thus: “Trade is a compassionate business.  
It is noble when it accords with the spirit of Buddha by profiting those who sell and those who buy and  
supplying the needs of the society.” These words became widely known as “Sampo-yoshi (meaning good  
for the seller, good for the buyer, and good for society),” the management philosophy of the merchants  
of Ohmi. This philosophy holds that to be sustainable  
over the long term, trade must contribute to society, as well as to the seller and the buyer.
