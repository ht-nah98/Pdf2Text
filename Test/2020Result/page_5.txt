A New Long March Forward
Corporate Mission
Sampo-yoshi
Guideline of Conduct
I am One with Infinite Missions
In April 2020, the ITOCHU Group established “Sampo-yoshi” as its revised corporate mission and positioned  
“I am One with Infinite Missions,” its former corporate message, as its Guideline of Conduct.
We will stay true to our merchant spirit, as Chubei Itoh I and our predecessors did, and accumulate businesses 
one by one as we go over the major mountain pass that is just in front of us. Through these efforts, we aim to 
generate a positive cycle of resolving social issues through business, realizing sustainable growth in corporate 
value. Our unwavering ideal, “Sampo-yoshi,” is key to pursuing these objectives.
