A small sampling of the messages  
“It is in times like these we need to remember to smile.”
“Spring is just around the corner.”
“Thanks for all the important work you do.”
“Starting today, it’s full speed ahead.”
with precision, we can compete sufficiently even if each 
business transaction is small. We diligently and routinely 
conduct business that pleases our customers, paying close 
attention to any subtle changes in order to fine-tune our 
policies. The FYE 2020 results proved the true value of this 
profit-making mindset, an approach unique to ITOCHU.

Keeping Our Promises
In the 11 years after the global financial crisis, the global 
economy had continued to expand. This left me worried 
that blowback could not be too far off. During the summer 
break in August last year, I decided to advance the semi-
annual business strategy meeting which is usually held in 
early October by one month, holding it in early September. 
At that meeting, we enacted countermeasures for worst-
case scenarios, focusing on the “prevent” and “cut” princi-
ples, which went into effect as of that day. Six months 
after, the threat materialized as the totally unforeseen 
COVID-19 pandemic. Still, ITOCHU was unshaken.

In FYE 2020, consolidated net profit exceeded ¥500.0 
billion for the second consecutive year, and we achieved 
record-high profits for the fourth year in a row. Although it 
is unfortunate we did not seize back the top spot, we were 
the No. 1 general trading company in terms of core profit, 
which proves our earning power. ROE was an industry-
leading 17.0%, and our net debt-to-shareholders’ equity 
ratio (NET DER) decreased to its best level ever. The price 
of ITOCHU’s shares set 22 record highs during the year.

  Amid this harsh environment, other general trading com-
panies had revised their forecasts downward and recorded 
lower profit. ITOCHU stood alone in achieving our initial 
plan like any other year by leveraging our robust earnings 
base that is strategically positioned across different fields 
to steadily build up profits, enabling us to pay the record-
high dividends we promised in the beginning of the year. 
This reassures me as a leader. To each and every Group 
employee, I would like to extend my sincerest thanks for 
their unparalleled effort.
I strongly believe that “we should always stand firmly

its businesses. A huge gap stood between our abilities and 
the general trading companies associated with the former 
zaibatsu industrial groups. To overcome this, we took a big 
gamble; we acquired shares of TOA Oil Co., Ltd., invested 
in state-of-the-art refineries, and concluded long-term 
charter contracts with oil tankers. These actions were 
based on the observation that oil was almost 100% 
imported and the hypothesis that since reserves were pre-
dicted to be in gradual decline, quickly acquiring crude oil 
would present a major business opportunity. However, the 
1970s were visited by two oil shocks. The hypothesis was 
ruthlessly shattered when we fixed our buying price high 
and the selling price plummeted, leading to huge losses.
  At the time, our judgment of resources was not as acute 
as those of other general trading companies associated 
with the former zaibatsu industrial groups. We relied only 
on a hypothesis, and only secured “products” without 
securing stable buyers in heavy industry. It was an idea 
solely based on a “product-oriented perspective.” It was 
similar to real estate investments during Japan’s economic 
bubble where people rode the bandwagon based on the 
hypothesis that prices could “only go up.” With the collapse 
of the bubble, losses cascaded. Even now, I can clearly 
recall that time. ITOCHU was pushed to the edge by the 
disposal of out of favor resources.
I believe it is extremely dangerous to make large invest-
ments relying on the hypothetical alone. This applies to 
the “Fourth Industrial Revolution” also, where Artificial 
Intelligence (AI) and other digital technologies are devel-
oping rapidly. A revolution does not guarantee that every 
related business will steadily grow. We must avoid investing 
recklessly.
  We have to conduct business with the realization that 
we are merchants. To achieve the same level as general 
trading companies associated with the former zaibatsu 
 industrial groups, which have prime assets in the resource 
sector, we naturally decided to compete in fields where we 
have an advantage, namely the non-resource sector, which 
is centered on consumer-related businesses. We do not 
have a “large chunk” of resource businesses that can 
generate hundreds of billions of yen in profit, but if we 
practice “spear-like” management and hit key points
