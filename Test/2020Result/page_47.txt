Business Investment Process
Under “Brand-new Deal 2020,” in addition to the conven-
tional investment process, we have further strengthened 
the earnings base to make it more resilient to economic 
fluctuation by thoroughly verifying the appropriateness 
of business plans and focusing on the monitoring of sub-
subsidiaries. Despite the challenging business environ-
ment, in FYE 2020 profits / losses of Group companies 
reached a record high for the fourth consecutive year. 
Besides, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the ratio of Group 
companies reporting profits remained high, at 88.6%.
  Given the rapidly changing business environment, we 
recognize that “prevent” efforts will be an even higher 
priority in FYE 2021 than in the past. By conducting careful 
and close monitoring, which is our forte as a company 
having strengths in the non-resource sector, we will strive 
to accurately ascertain risks unique to individual busi-
nesses. If we anticipate impairment concerns that could 
result from lower share prices or decreased earnings, we 
will act preemptively.
