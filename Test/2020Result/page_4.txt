“Sampo-yoshi,” Our Values for Creating the Future
2020
New Troubled Waters
In 2020, the growing impact of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is causing major disruption to societies  
and economies around the world. To date, ITOCHU has steadily increased corporate value based on the 
“Brand-new Deal” strategy, by leveraging the true value of its strengths including its earning power in the 
non-resource sector. Even so, we cannot escape the impact of the current economic disruptions. It is not easy 
to determine our management strategy amid the growing uncertainty about the future. However, with the 
merchant spirit we inherited from our founder, we will remain resolute despite the dark clouds ahead.
