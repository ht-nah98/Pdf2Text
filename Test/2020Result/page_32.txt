The “Merchant” Business Model
Pursuing “All the Priorities,”  
Not Just “a Single Expedient”
For more than 160 years, the “Sampo-yoshi” spirit has represented our unwavering ideal as a merchant. In 
keeping with this focus, rather than seeking to achieve a single target of either economic or social value, or either 
short-term targets or steppingstones for medium- to long-term growth, we aim to achieve “all the priorities.” 
  Each of the merchants of the Group in charge of “Infinite Missions” makes the most of his or her “individual 
 capabilities” to further enhance corporate value.
