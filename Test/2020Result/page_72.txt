Human Resource Strategy 
One of ITOCHU’s most important attributes is that it advocates the “creation of company environments that are 
strict but rewarding” and its management is  committed to realizing these environments. By clearly positioning 
a human resource strategy consisting of various measures as a management strategy, we elicit the maximum 
“individual capabilities” from our employees, who are the driving force behind the functioning of ITOCHU’s 
business models. As a result, we have steadily increased labor productivity at ITOCHU with the smallest head-
count among major general trading companies on a non-consolidated basis.
In addition, by raising their awareness of participation in management, we encourage employees to unite their 
“individual capabilities,” an ITOCHU strength, and align themselves in the direction of management. This is a 
further driving force for the virtuous cycle that leads to sustainable increases in corporate value. We plan to 
 introduce additional measures that will strengthen this cycle even more.
