Centered on items related to following five sections:

•   Structure of advisory committees to the Board of Directors
•   Roles and duties of the Board of Directors
•   Operation status of the Board of Directors
•   Information provision and training for Members of the Board and Audit & Supervisory Board Members
•    In addition to scores improving in the majority of the questionnaires, the effectiveness of the Board of Directors has 
made further progress through means including:
(1) Progress in external form such as improvement of diversity and the structure of advisory committees
(2)  Invigoration of discussions in the Board of Directors through improvements in proceedings and operation of meetings
(3) Enhancement of information sharing
•  With regard to the operation of the Board of Directors based on the transition to a Monitoring-Focused Structure, 
which was recognized as an ongoing issue in the previous evaluation, discussions were held with the goal of improv-
ing medium- to long-term corporate value, which ITOCHU seeks in its management strategy and corporate mission, 
and steady progress was observed
•    As remaining issues, there is a need for initiatives to address:
(1) Further diversity in the Board of Directors
(2) The further enhancement of medium- to long-term discussions in the Board of Directors
(3) The strengthening of provision of information to Outside Directors and Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members
Initiatives for More Constructive Discussions
ITOCHU takes various steps to ensure the Board of Directors can have more lively discussions by deepening the 
understanding of the Outside Directors and Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members of the overall state of operations 
and issues pertaining to its diverse businesses as a general trading company.
  For example, in preliminary briefings about proposals for meetings of the Board of Directors, we endeavor to provide 
useful information and clear, detailed briefings about the specifics and backgrounds of each proposal in order to deepen 
the understanding of Outside Directors and Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members on perspectives and key points 
that should be discussed. The Corporate Planning & Administration Division is in charge of leading the preliminary briefings 
with explanations of not only the details of each proposal, but also their position in overall management, for the purpose of 
facilitating the exchange of essential opinions based on the actual conditions of the ITOCHU Group.
  Moreover, opportunities to visit business sites at subsidiaries and affiliates inside and outside Japan are periodically 
created. The aim is to increase the effectiveness of the Board of Directors by having Outside Directors and Outside Audit & 
Supervisory Board Members directly exchange opinions with management teams, engage in dialogue with employees, and 
see firsthand the products and services offered.
