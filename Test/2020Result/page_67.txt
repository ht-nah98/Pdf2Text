Identification and Review of Material Issues
Sustainability Promotion Framework
Since ITOCHU first identified material issues in 2013, we 
have conducted regular reviews based on trends in the in-
ternational community and the expectations of stakeholders. 
In FYE 2019, when the previous medium-term management 
plan kicked off, we identified seven material issues based 
on the adoption of the SDGs, the Paris Agreement on 
climate change coming into effect, and other social devel-
opments and changes affecting business. In the FYE 2021 
Management Plan, we continue to apply them.
The Sustainability Management Department plans 
measures to advance sustainability. After these are decided 
by the CAO, they are carried out by each organization. The 
Sustainability Committee deliberates and makes decisions 
concerning formulation and revision of basic policies and 
important matters. Through dialogue with stakeholders 
such as the Advisory Board, we gain an understanding of 
society’s expectations and demands, etc., which we use in 
our efforts to promote sustainability.
