Steppingstones to Medium- to Long-Term Value Creation
While achieving our short-term targets, we reinforce 
measures in fields of strength, make advances in environ-
mental businesses, and evolve businesses based on 
a market-oriented perspective. In such ways, we lay 
steppingstones for a solid growth trajectory over the 
medium to long term.

By acquiring further business oppor-
tunities and maximizing synergies 
in fields and regions where we have 
strengths, we will take a medium- to 
long-term perspective as we enhance 
corporate value. 
We intend to resolve social issues in  
a manner that contributes to the en-
hancement of our corporate value. By 
taking full advantage of our strengths 
as a general trading company, we will 
expand and actively promote envi-
ronmental businesses.
In the storage battery business, we 
aim to harness a market-oriented 
 perspective and an ecosystem that 
shares value among all stakeholders 
as the driving force. We leverage our 
strengths as a general trading 
company to achieve sustainable 
increase in value. 
Initiatives and Systems Supporting Sustainable Growth
To increase the sustainability of value creation through 
lowering the cost of capital, we will continue to step up 
sustainability initiatives, pursue a human resource strategy 
directly linked with the enhancement of corporate value, 
and make advances in our corporate governance system.

We will lay appropriate forward- 
looking foundations by conducting 
scenario analyses to determine 
impact on individual businesses. 
And we will continue to shore up 
our robust earnings base, centered 
on consumer-related businesses.
By clearly identifying our human 
resource strategy as our management 
strategy, we will take advantage of our 
strength in “individual capabilities” to 
achieve increases in labor productivity, 
generating sustainable increases in 
corporate value in a positive cycle. 
We will continue advancing toward an 
effective and transparent governance 
system as a foundation for sustain-
able increases in economic and social 
value.
