Sustainability Initiatives for Sustained Corporate Value Creation
ITOCHU conducts business globally under the Group corporate mission of “Sampo-yoshi,” our founding spirit. 
As such, we consider addressing global environmental and social issues to be one of the top priority issues in 
our management policy. We contribute to the realization of a sustainable society in order to achieve the goals of 
the Group Guideline of Conduct, “I am One with Infinite Missions.”
  We have established the Basic Policy on Promotion of Sustainability in accordance with our corporate mission 
and the dynamic environment in which we operate, and promote initiatives in an organized and systematic 
manner. We have also determined our material issues, which are priority issues that we should resolve, and in-
corporated these into our Sustainability Action Plans. While maintaining and increasing our earning power, we 
will achieve both a sustainable increase in corporate value and resolving social issues through our trade and 
business investment activities.
