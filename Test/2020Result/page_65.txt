Initiatives and Systems Supporting Sustainable Growth
Relationship between Maintaining and Upgrading of Non-Financial Capital and Material Issues
ITOCHU has identified its corporate mission of “Sampo-
yoshi ” which embodies its material sustainability issues and 
works to resolve material issues through its business. In this 
way, we maintain and expand  our non-financial capital that 
we have accumulated by leveraging the trust and creditwor-
thiness, and realize a sustainable increase in corporate value.
