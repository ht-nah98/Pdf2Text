non-fossil certificates 
Steppingstones to Medium- to Long-Term Value Creation
  Agile asset replacement measures for better asset utilization efficiencies and acquisitions of new assets to expand the 
earnings base
  Establishing strong working ties with reputable partners in the upstream sector, along with making continuous invest-
ments to secure more efficient operations base and to expand our asset base in the efforts to sustain our access to the 
competitive and secure energy supply source
  Expand initiatives leveraging breadth of the business domain, ranging from energy solutions and renewable energy to 
optimal charging and discharging services utilizing the energy storage system
Initiatives Supporting Sustainable Growth
  Efforts made and measures taken in our businesses to reduce GHG emissions and to pursue businesses with low envi-

Specific Example of Steppingstones to Medium- to Long-Term Value Creation
Establishment of the Power & Environmental Solution Division
In FYE 2021, ITOCHU established the Power & Environmental 
Solution Division.
  The power sector has undergone significant change in recent 
years. On the generation side, renewable energy has made inroads, 
and the market for distributed power generation has expanded due 
to solar power generation and storage batteries utilizing household 
or industrial roofs. Power trading has changed as well. Trading in 
CO2-free electricity (through the use of non-fossil certificates) has 
begun, evincing a rapid shift from the conventional business model 
driven by electric power producers to one led by customers and 
consumers. In addition, consumption of electricity is expected to 
grow in line with proliferation of the fifth-generation mobile telecom-
munications system (5G). Given this situation, we established the 
new division to provide broad-ranging power and storage battery so-
lutions in Japan and overseas based on a market-oriented perspec-
tive. By stepping up our initiatives in the electric power and storage 
battery business, we will contribute toward the more stable power 
supply as well as the realization of a society that utilizes distributed 
energy resources.
