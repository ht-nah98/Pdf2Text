ITOCHU’s Share Price Performance vs. TOPIX after Announcing “Brand-new Deal 2020”*
With no KPIs indicated in “Brand-new Deal 2020” for the second and subsequent 
years, the Company’s share price tumbled. Learning from this, ITOCHU introduced a 
variety of measures, including the “Medium- to Long-Term Shareholder Returns 
Policy.” Going forward, we aim to enhance corporate value further through initiatives 
that directly address management issues we have uncovered through dialogue.

Steadily Moving Forward—Can ITOCHU Break through 
to Reinvention?
The general trading company business model is changing from a 
 trading-oriented model to one based on business investment, and 
in recent years the Company has turned toward a strategy of 
 augmenting business value by contributing actively to investees’ busi-
nesses. With peer companies struggling with low levels of profitability 
due to large investments and across-the-board investments, ITOCHU 
is focusing on consumer-related businesses—an area of expertise. 
The Company also focuses carefully on the profitability of investees via 
thorough cost management, therefore realizes steady profit growth 
and high profitability. While advances in information technology 
present general trading companies with good opportunities to create 
new businesses, such advances also pose the risk of making existing 
businesses obsolete. Reinventing its businesses in response to 
consumer needs and using its investment in CITIC as a lever to 
access China’s massive internal demand pose issues, as well as 
growth opportunities. We will be monitoring the situation.
Already Means Not Yet
In its dialogue with the stock market, I give the Company high marks 
for the way top management took this input seriously. However, 
ITOCHU still needs to surmount a number of issues. In the short term, 
it needs to complete share buybacks. In the medium to long term, it 
needs to clarify its growth strategy, including the creation of synergies 
with CITIC, as well as further moves on climate change. Notably, low 
cash returns from CITIC are one reason the stock market is discount-
ing ITOCHU’s shares. At present, we believe ITOCHU can maintain 
high ROE in FYE 2025, but I would like to see management set its 
sights even higher, at some “market expectation +.” If it can present 
a growth-oriented solution, ITOCHU may be able to change the way 
its shares are valued, stepping outside the framework of a general 
trading company.
