range of products and services and creating new businesses. 
We will also continue promoting balanced initiatives that take 
into consideration “all the priorities” including the environment 
and society, and not just “a single expedient.”
  We will continue striving to sustainably enhance corpo-
rate value by diligently maintaining our unique, unshakable 
focus. This will also lead to a reduction in the cost of 
capital. Before concluding, I would like to mention that in 
June 2020 ITOCHU’s share price and market capitalization 
attained the top spot in the general trading sector. I would 
like to express my deepest gratitude to all our shareholders 
and investors. Moving forward, I intend to continue 
pursuing management that fully lives up to the expecta-
tions of our diverse stakeholders.
