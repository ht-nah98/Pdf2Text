Atsuko Muraki
Outside Director
Ms. Muraki assumed a position as member 
of the Board of Directors at ITOCHU in 
June 2016, after serving as Vice Minister 
of Health, Labour and Welfare. She served 
as Chairman of the Governance and 
Remuneration Committee in FYE 2020, 
leading discussions regarding Corporate 
Officer remuneration, etc. She has provided 
many helpful suggestions concerning internal 
control, compliance, deploying personnel, 
and strengthening organizations.
Aiming for Long-Term Increases in Corporate Value
Since being appointed as an Outside Director of ITOCHU, 
I have served as a member of the Governance and 
Remuneration Committee, and I also chaired the same 
committee in FYE 2019 and FYE 2020, fulfilling my role 
as Outside Director through deep involvement in changing 
the Company’s corporate governance for the better. During 
my tenure, I have experienced major changes as the Board 
of Directors transitioned to a monitoring-focused structure. 
Thereafter, the Company’s corporate governance system 
has steadily improved with each passing year, including 
an increase in the ratio of Outside Directors to 40%.
  The Corporate Officer remuneration system, one of 
the major topics of discussion by the Governance and 
Remuneration Committee, is designed to reflect in the 
 remuneration of each Corporate Officer’s role and contribu-
tion to performance, with the aim of winning the trust of 
shareholders and other stakeholders.
  There is no goal for advancing corporate governance. 
Therefore, we continue to seek to create an even better 
system through constant revisions in response to the rapidly 
changing external business environment. In FYE 2021, as 
the Chairman of the Nomination Committee, I will work to 
improve ITOCHU’s corporate value by strengthening the 
Company’s corporate governance system through examin-
ing succession plans, an important corporate governance 
issue for the Company, and through discussions about 
 personnel matters relating to Board Members.
