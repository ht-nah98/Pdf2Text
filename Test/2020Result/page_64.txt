Initiatives and Systems Supporting Sustainable Growth
Relationship between a Logic Tree, Non-Financial Capital,  
and Material Issues
Logic Tree of the FYE 2021 Management Plan
ITOCHU started the medium-term management plan, “Brand-new Deal 2020,” in FYE 2019 and has accomplished and 
completed it one year ahead of schedule. With the business environment undergoing tumultuous changes, mainly due to 
the impact of COVID-19, we have formulated a single-year plan for FYE 2021, in which we will consolidate our footing by 
thoroughly instilling the “earn, cut, prevent” principles. In this way, we will spend this year on steadily preparing for another 
forward leap in the future.
