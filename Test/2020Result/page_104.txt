The vigorous digital transformation that is occurring as part of the Fourth Industrial Revolution is prompting the emergence of services 
and business models that ITOCHU will no longer be able to handle via its conventional vertical, product-based organization. To respond 
with sensitivity to such changes, The 8th Company will adopt a market-oriented perspective. By making full use of ITOCHU’s various 
business foundations, particularly those that are strong in the consumer sector, we aim to cultivate new businesses and customers.
Example of New Business Development <Lab Stores>
  We are using FamilyMart lab stores to run proof-of-concept tests on new technologies and services in a wide variety of fields. 
  We are striving for agile improvements and optimization, aiming to expand to many of 16,500 FamilyMart stores around Japan.
  In addition, we are working with strategic partners to roll out these new technologies and services to customers in the retail and 
other industries in an effort to increase economic and social value.
