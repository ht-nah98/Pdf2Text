Corporate Officer Remuneration
A Highly Transparent Remuneration Plan Linked to Corporate Value
ITOCHU’s remuneration plan for Directors is designed to 
be an incentive to grow business performance. Every fiscal 
year, the Board of Directors passes a resolution on Director 
remuneration based on the deliberations of the Governance 
and Remuneration Committee, an advisory committee to the 
Board of Directors.
  Performance-linked bonus has a high proportion of overall 
remuneration. This percentage is not fixed at a certain level, 
and it slides upwards as the Company’s earnings expand. 
Consolidated net profit is the key performance-linked 
indicator, a metric of high interest to the stock market for 
representing the source of funding for growth investments 
and shareholder returns. To raise awareness of contributing 
to medium- to long-term expansion in earnings and 
corporate value, a portion of remuneration includes stock 
remuneration. In addition, share price-linked bonuses 
depend on the rate of growth in the Company’s share 
price between FYE 2019 and FYE 2021.
  To maintain high levels of transparency, ITOCHU has 
externally disclosed the details of this remuneration system, 
including the calculation method.
  As of FYE 2021, the remuneration system for Directors 
(excluding Outside Directors) is as follows.
