ITOCHU’s Policy on the Governance of Its Listed Subsidiaries
Generating Synergies While Ensuring Autonomy
Significance of holdings of listed subsidiaries includes the increases in transactions based on the reputation, credibility 
and an independent standpoint away from ITOCHU, as well as the expansion of synergies within the Group, including 
with ITOCHU.
In October 2019, ITOCHU announced the following policies regarding listed subsidiaries in light of the growing interest of 
shareholders and institutional investors in parent-subsidiary listings, based on the idea that ITOCHU appropriately protecting 
the interests of general shareholders in listed subsidiaries would ultimately increase the corporate value of the listed subsidiaries.
1  In case that there is a listed subsidiary in the ITOCHU Group, ITOCHU respects the autonomy of the listed subsidiary and 
prohibits any acts that contradict the principle of shareholder equality.
2  In particular, with the recognition that there is a potential conflict of interest between ITOCHU and the minority shareholders 
of the listed subsidiary and in order to secure the independent decision-making of the listed subsidiary, we request the 
listed subsidiary to set up the governance structure under which the independent outside directors of the listed subsidiary 
are well functioned.
3  With respect to the listed subsidiary, ITOCHU will perform its accountability as to the rationale to maintain the listed 
 parent-subsidiary relationship as well as the effectiveness of the governance structure of the listed subsidiary.
State of Governance Systems at Listed Subsidiaries
ITOCHU requires that its listed subsidiaries (1) have independent outside directors for at least one-third of its directors, 
(2) establish independent advisory committees for their board of directors, and (3) have independent outside members for a 
majority on their audit & supervisory boards. At the listed subsidiaries shown below, governance systems have been put into 
place that mostly satisfy these requirements.
