Human Resource Strategy 
Increase Awareness of Participation in Management (Shared Value with Shareholders)
Shareholder-Conscious Stock Compensation Scheme
To achieve sustainable increases in corporate value, we 
believe it is important for employees, in addition to the 
management team, to take part in management. We have  
encouraged participation in our employee shareholding  
association, and the participation level reached almost 
100% in FYE 2019. Going further, in FYE 2020 we used this 
association to introduce a stock compensation scheme. 
Under this scheme, we pay special incentives when the 
Company’s performance reaches a certain level, granting 
shares as consideration.
