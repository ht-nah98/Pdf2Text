The Positive Cycle of Dialogue and Enhancing Corporate Value
ITOCHU emphasizes dialogue with its shareholders, investors, and other stakeholders from the perspective of 
achieving sustainable growth and enhancing corporate value over the medium to long term. After announcing 
“Brand-new Deal 2020,” which failed to give due consideration to market expectations, the Company’s share 
price plunged. Learning from this experience, we now strive to reflect input obtained in investor meetings, 
general meetings of shareholders, and one-on-one meetings into our management strategies and financial 
and capital policies. Through commitment-based management, we are striving to expand corporate value 
and sustain a positive cycle through effective engagement.
Examples of Feedback from Shareholders and Investors
Achievement of  
Short-Term Targets
Steppingstones to 
Medium- to Long-
Term Value Creation
•  General trading companies’ results are affected significantly by fluctuations in resource prices, so results are highly volatile.
•  The impact of COVID-19 on performance is unclear. As far as possible, I would like to see the Company disclose 
 information and outline its directions.
•  The shareholder returns policy unveiled along with “Brand-new Deal 2020,” the medium-term management plan, was 
vague and less attractive than expected.
•  The measures for enhancing corporate value described in “Brand-new Deal 2020” were abstract and difficult to 
 understand. No KPIs were provided.
•  The “reinvention of business” policy was vague; no specific actions were evident.
•  I would like the Company to indicate specific growth strategies. In particular, no specific results are apparent through 
collaboration with CITIC and CP Group.
•  I find it unfortunate that no progress was made on the share buybacks announced in June 2019.
