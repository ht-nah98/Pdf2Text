•  Even in the “under 2˚C” 
scenario, we can maintain

ing the number of new renew-
able energy plants.
•  In the “under 2˚C” scenario, 
use of fossil fuels will be 
reduced as a result of tech-
nological innovation and 
changes in regulatory trends,

coal, which has a relatively 
lower environmental impact, 
will remain at a certain level.

portfolio that anticipates an

opportunities).
•  We will diversify production

researching and selecting va-

improving seedling cultivation 
methods).

We will aim to further improve 
the Dole brand and product

of highly environmentally 
 conscious consumers.

revenue due to an increase 
in pulp production output in 
some afforestation areas 
where production output is 
expected to expand under 
the “around 4˚C” scenario. 
Nevertheless, our analysis 
shows that our overall 
revenue will decrease due to 
the impact of the reduction 
in production output in most 
afforestation areas with the 
rise in the average global 
temperature.
•  We will maintain production 
output at a certain level in 
 afforestation areas with the 
suppression in the rise of the 
average temperature in the 
“under 2˚C” scenario. If the 
carbon prices are introduced 
in pulp manufacturing facto-
ries using biomass energy, we 
will be able to curtail costs. In 
addition, we will be able to 
increase profit by augmenting 
revenue with an increase in 
our pulp production output in 
afforestation areas where pro-
duction output is expected to 
expand.
•  We will examine a selection of 
varieties to respond to climate 
change.
•  We will conduct on-site moni-
toring to examine measures 
before the impact of climate 
change becomes significant.
