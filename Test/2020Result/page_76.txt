Overview of the Corporate Governance System
As a company with Audit & Supervisory Board Members (Audit & Supervisory Board), ITOCHU is always imple-
menting measures to strengthen management supervision. After transitioning to a monitoring-focused Board of 
Directors in FYE 2018, the Company increased the ratio of Outside Directors to at least one-third, and intends 
to maintain this ratio. As advisory committees to the Board of Directors, the Governance and Remuneration 
Committee and the Nomination Committee have been established with an Outside Director as the Chairman 
and Outside Directors forming a majority of members.
ITOCHU’s Inside Directors are nominated from a pool of personnel who have abundant business experience 
and general knowledge about the management of general trading companies. Outside Directors are appointed 
from a pool of diverse candidates who have expertise in certain fields. Furthermore, Outside Audit & Supervisory 
Board Members are selected from candidates who have extensive knowledge in finance, accounting, or legal 
affairs. They facilitate the neutral and objective supervision and oversight of the Company’s management.
  The following outlines ITOCHU’s corporate governance system, the role of each Outside Director and Outside 
Audit & Supervisory Board Member, and their primary fields of expertise.
