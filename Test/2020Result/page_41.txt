Relationship between the Corporate Mission of “Sampo-yoshi” and Increase in Corporate Value
On April 1, 2020, we changed our Group corporate mission to “Sampo-yoshi.” Through our business as a general trading company,  
we earn the trust and creditworthiness from various stakeholders in the spirit of “Sampo-yoshi.” We will leverage these to strengthen  
a cycle of value creation. 
  Our policy is to promote business activities with an awareness of our external capital, which are clients, partners, natural resources, 
and society, and to promote internalization of these external capital. This results in interaction between our external capital and our 
existing internal capital, which will enable us to realize even more sustainable creation of corporate value.
