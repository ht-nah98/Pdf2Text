Specific Example of Initiatives Supporting Sustainable Growth
Pineapple Production Business in Sierra Leone
ITOCHU established Sierra Tropical Limited in Sierra Leone in 
June 2014 through Dole, a subsidiary, to begin pineapple culti-
vation and production of processed foods containing pineapple. 
To expand production, the company is currently raising seedlings 
and has started building a plant to process pineapples. It aims to 
commence commercial production at an early stage.
  By diversifying its production bases, ITOCHU aims to establish 
a stable pineapple production system that is not affected by 
weather risk and further enhance Dole’s processed foods 
business on a global scale. In addition, the business is aimed at 
contributing to the local community by cultivating local industry, 
thereby creating employment and improving living environments.
